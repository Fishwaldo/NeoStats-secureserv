SecureServ 0.9 Release Notes - 24/5/2003
========================================
THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE. YOU ARE WARNED.

TODO List.
- Not everything I had planned for SecureServ is implemented in this
  release. This includes:
  - Anti Virus Channel Support Functions
  - NickFlood Detection Code

- I'm still not comfortable with the FloodChecking Code on Channels.
  Currently, it will only broadcast messages in the services channel about
  floods, but wont actually take any action. (even though it says it does)

- AutoUpdate support isn't actually fully implemented. You must still
  /msg SecureServ update to update the Definitions file. 

- Read the README file Please. It contains VERY important information. Read
  it again if you have already read it.
