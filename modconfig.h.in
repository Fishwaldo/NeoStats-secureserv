doesn't have the strerror() or memmove() functions that should be present in
all Standard C libraries. The macros HAVE_STRERROR and HAVE_MEMMOVE should
normally be defined with the value 1 for other systems, but unfortunately we
can't make this the default because "configure" files generated by autoconf
will only change 0 to 1; they won't change 1 to 0 if the functions are not
found. */

longer patterns in extreme cases. On Unix systems, "configure" can be used to

catch runaway regular expressions that take for ever to determine that they do
not match. The default is set very large so that it does not accidentally catch
legitimate cases. On Unix systems, "configure" can be used to override this
default default. */
