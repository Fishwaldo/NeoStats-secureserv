SecureServ 0.9.1 Release Notes - 30/5/2003
========================================
THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE. YOU ARE WARNED.

TODO List.
- Not everything I had planned for SecureServ is implemented in this
  release. This includes:
  - Anti Virus Channel Support Functions

- NickFlood Code has been implemented, but not enforced. You will get
  messages in your services channel if SecureServ detects NickFloods, but it
  wont actually do anything (yet)

- If you wish to take advantage of updated Definition files, you *MUST*
  apply for a account at http://secure.irc-chat.net/ (currently 80
  Signatures)

- New Set Options have been Implemented. Read the Manual for updated
  information.
