This document will aid you in setting up and running SercureServ on your IRC network.</p><p>SecureServ is a advanced IRC Trojan detector, much like a Virus Scanner, but aimed for IRC networks. Using Several different methods, including, but not limited to Version checks, Behavior analysis, and general pattern matching, it aims to detect Trojans and Virus's as well as FloodBots that connect to your IRC network.</p><p>SecureServ's "brains" are based on a "Definition file" or Dat file, that contain information on how to detect the trojans. This means to update SecureServ's detection for new Trojans/Bots only requires that you download a new dat file (which can be automated). There are some pre-conditions to obtaining new Dat files, and these can be found in the Installation chapter.</p><p>Additionally, with 1.0 version of SecureServ, we now support a "customised" dat file that administrators can add their own signatures to to help detect new, or unsupported clients/trojans. (eg, Bottlers). This requires some programing knowledge, and more information about the customviri.dat file can be found in the "Custom Definitions" chapter. </p><p>SecureServ can detect Trojan/Virus's or "Security Risks" to your Network a number of ways, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CTCP Version Checks</p></li><li><p>NickName Patterns</p></li><li><p>UserName (Ident) Patterns</p></li><li><p>RealName Patterns</p></li><li><p>Channel MemberShip Patterns</p></li><li><p>Private/Notice Messages</p></li><li><p>Channel Utilization</p></li><li><p>Logic Checks</p></li></ul></div><p>While we can detect a vast majority of Trojans, and its easy to extend SecureServ to detect new ones without Recompiling/upgrading, its not a fullproof solution. Additionally, Virus/Trojan/Bot authors are getting more and more sophisticated these days, and will always find ways to avoid detection. SecureServ aims to reduce the load on a Network Administration staff in dealing with these Trojans.</p><p>SecureServ is written and maintained by Justin Hammond. It requires the NeoStats software. More information about SecureServ, or NeoStats, can be found at <a href="#">http://www.neostats.net/</a></p><p>SecureServ is Copyright, 2003 by Justin Hammond.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e47"></a>1.&nbsp;Prerequisites and Installation.</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>SecureServ is designed to run on Top of NeoStats. The Following requirements at the time of writing are required for NeoStats:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A Linux or BSD based Server or Shell.</p></li><li><p>A supported IRCd. Currently, Hybrid7, Unreal, Ultimate2.x or Ultimate3.x or NeoIRCd</p></li><li><p>Some basic Unix administration Skill</p></li><li><p>Of Course, a IRC network to connect it all together.</p></li></ul></div><p>Please refer to the NeoStats website for more information on the requirements</p><p>SecureServ itself requires the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NeoStats 2.5.9 or Higher correctly installed and Running</p></li><li><p>A account on <a href="#">http://secure.irc-chat.net</a> is required if you wish to take advantage of updated definition files</p></li><li><p>The time to read this entire document. </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>SecureServ has the potential to Akill/Gline your entire network. Its strongly suggested that you read this entire document before even attempting to compile SecureServ, as I'm just going to laugh, if you didn't read, and it AKILL's your entire network. </p></div></li></ul></div><p>The requirement to have a valid account on <a href="#">http://secure.irc-chat.net</a> is due to the fact that I want to have some control over who receives the definition files. If these Definition files fall into the hands of the TrojanWritters or Virus Writers, its possible they might be able to re-write their bots to avoid detection. Please see the website for more information.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e90"></a>1.1.&nbsp;Compiling and Installation</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>As long as you have successfully setup NeoStats, and installed it correctly, Compiling SecureServ is very simple and straight forward. First you must extract the files from the download package. This is as simple as:</p><pre class="screen">bash$<span><b class="command"> tar -xzf SecureServ-&lt;ver&gt;.tar.gz</b></span></pre><p>This should then create a directory called SecureServ-&lt;version&gt; where &lt;version&gt; is the Version of SecureServ. Then Proceed to Change into the SecureServ directory, and run Configure as follows:</p><pre class="screen">bash$<span><b class="command">./configure [--enable-debug | --with-neostats=&lt;dir&gt;]</b></span></pre><p>--enable-debug is only useful for diagnostics purposes when used in conjunction with debugging tools. There should be no need to use this option on a day to day basis</p><p>--with-neostats=&lt;dir&gt; should be used if your neostats directory is not in a standard location (~/NeoStats/). Replace &lt;dir&gt; with the full path to your NeoStats installation directory (NOT SOURCE DIRECTORY)</p><p>Configuring SecureServ will look something like the following screen:</p><pre class="screen">[Fish@fish-dt]$ ./configure

</pre><p>If the configuration did not produce a error, you may then move onto Compiling SecureServ. Compiling is simply just issuing the "make" command (or "gmake" if you are running BSD):</p><pre class="screen">[Fish@fish-dt]$ make
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. SecureServ.c

These users are granted the ability to "release" a infected user from SecureServ or kill un-cooperative, or unresponsive users that SecureServ has identified as being infected. Users that have been joined to the help channel are "held" by SecureServ and are usually prevented from joining other channels (if your IRCd supports this option). This can be helpful so you can clean up users that are infected with simple script based virus's and you require their attention to help you clean their computer.

Examples of the messages its send is a "Warning message" to users that they are about to be checked for Virus's, and also messages when they AKILL or warn a user about a possible "Trojan/Infection" etc. These messages can be customized to suit your network, or language of choice easily. The different messages that you can set are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>"Greeting" messages</p><p>Greeting Messages are sent to uses when they sign on your Network. They are just to inform the user that a CTCP VERSION check is being conducted.</p></li><li><p>"AKILL" messages</p><p>AKILL messages are sent to users when they are about to be akilled from your network due to a positive "infection". You could provide email addresses, contact information, should the user wish to contact you. In addition to the AKILL message, the user is also given a URL they can view with details about their "infection" and how to fix it.</p></li><li><p>"No Help Available" messages</p><p>As SecureServ can also detect Virus's, some network may have channels devoted to helping users remove virus's from their IRC clients. SecureServ has a "Helper" login function that allows you to setup "non-oper" or "oper" users to be helpers. If no one is logged into SecureServ and a virus infected user is detected, instead of attempting to automatically join him to the "Help" channel, he is akilled from the network. This message is sent to the user to let them know that they have a virus, and should seek help.</p></li></ul></div><p>Setting these three types of messages is simple. Just issue the following commands:</p><pre class="screen">/msg SecureServ set signonmsg &lt;message&gt;</pre><pre class="screen">/msg SecureServ set akillmesg &lt;message&gt;</pre><pre class="screen">/msg SecureServ set nohelpmsg &lt;message&gt;</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you don't customize any of these messages, a Default system message is used automatically.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e315"></a>3.&nbsp;Detailed Configuration</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>SecureServ attempts to be as configurable as possible in order to cater for each individual networks requirements. This in turn though makes the configuration very complex.

It is not the same as a wildcard field. Regular expressions are much more powerful pattern matching expressions than the standard ? and * options available in typical filesystem or IRC pattern matching code. If you have never used regular expression before, I STRONGLY suggest you test your "Regular expression" code with a utility called "pcretest" available as part of libpcre at www.pcre.org. Additionally, you should try to learn the pattern matching language. This can be done by looking at the man page for "perlre" or the documentation available on www.pcre.org. If you get your pattern matching code wrong, you have the ability to kill everyone on your IRC network, so be extremely careful.</p></div><p>This field must be enclosed in double quotation marks (") and if you use " in your regular expression, you must escape them.</p><p><span class="bold"><b><tt class="varname">message</tt></b></span></p><p>This is the private message sent to the "Infected" user when they are matched against this definition. As customviri.dat definitions do not direct users to the secure.irc-chat.net. site, you should provide as much information as possible in this, or optionally, direct them to your own hosted IRC page. You should place your message inside double quotation marks (") and if you use " in your regular expression, you must escape them.</p><p><span class="bold"><b><tt class="varname">action</tt></b></span></p><p>This field defines what SecureServ should do when it matches a user against this definition.

Do not take any further action.</p><p>We don't support any customviri.dat definitions, either by the secure.irc-chat.net site, or via our boards, though members of the community may choose to share their customviri.dat files. If you are in doubt or unsure about creating your own customviri.dat files you should always test them with the warn or nothing option as the action type until you are sure that you have the matching correct.</p></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e941"></a>5.1.3.&nbsp;Reload the definitions</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>If SecureServ is already operating, you can reload the definitions by issuing a /msg SecureServ reload command. This will make SecureServ reload both the viri.dat file as well as the customviri.dat file. Your customviri.dat entries will be placed before any viri.dat entries, so if you wish to override the action of a viri.dat entry, you can place a copy in the customviri.dat file.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e946"></a>6.&nbsp;Final Words</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>This Section is my "Rant" for SecureServ.
