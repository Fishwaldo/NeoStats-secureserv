  <title>SecureServ 3.0 Manual</title>

  <para>Welcome to the SecureServ Manual. This document will aid you in
  setting up and running SercureServ on your IRC network.</para>

  <para>SecureServ is a advanced IRC Trojan detector, much like a Virus
  Scanner, but aimed for IRC networks. Using Several different methods,
  including, but not limited to Version checks, Behavior analysis, and general
  pattern matching, it aims to detect Trojans and Virus's as well as FloodBots
  that connect to your IRC network.</para>

  <para>SecureServ's "brains" are based on a "Definition file" or Dat file,
  that contain information on how to detect the trojans. This means to update
  SecureServ's detection for new Trojans/Bots only requires that you download
  a new dat file (which can be automated). There are some pre-conditions to
  obtaining new Dat files, and these can be found in the Installation
  chapter.</para>

  <para>SecureServ also supports a "customised" dat file that administrators
  can add their own signatures to to help detect new, or unsupported
  clients/trojans. (eg, Bottlers). This requires some programing knowledge,
  and more information about the customviri.dat file can be found in the
  "Custom Definitions" chapter.</para>

  <para>SecureServ can detect Trojan/Virus's or "Security Risks" to your
  Network a number of ways, including:</para>

  <para>While we can detect a vast majority of Trojans, and its easy to extend
  SecureServ to detect new ones without Recompiling/upgrading, its not a
  fullproof solution. Additionally, Virus/Trojan/Bot authors are getting more
  and more sophisticated these days, and will always find ways to avoid
  detection. SecureServ aims to reduce the load on a Network Administration
  staff in dealing with these Trojans.</para>

  <para>SecureServ is written and maintained by Justin Hammond. It requires
  the NeoStats software. More information about SecureServ, or NeoStats, can
  be found at <link linkend="???">http://www.neostats.net/</link></para>

    <title>Prerequisites and Installation.</title>

    <para>SecureServ is designed to run on Top of NeoStats. The Following
    requirements at the time of writing are required for
    NeoStats:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A Linux or BSD based Server or Shell.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A IRCd supported by NeoStats. See the <link

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>Please refer to the NeoStats website for more information on the
    requirements</para>

    <para>SecureServ itself requires the following:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>NeoStats 3.0 or Higher correctly installed and Running</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A NeoNet account <link
          linkend="???">http://accounts.neostats.net</link> is required if you
          wish to take advantage of updated definition files</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The time to read this entire document. <warning>
              <para>SecureServ has the potential to Akill/Gline your entire
              network. Its strongly suggested that you read this entire
              document before even attempting to compile SecureServ, as I'm
              just going to laugh, if you didn't read, and it AKILL's your
              entire network.</para>
            </warning></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>The requirement to have a valid account on <link
    linkend="???">http://accounts.neostats.net</link> is due to the fact that
    I want to have some control over who receives the definition files. If
    these Definition files fall into the hands of the TrojanWritters or Virus
    Writers, its possible they might be able to re-write their bots to avoid
    detection. Please see the website for more information.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Compiling and Installation</title>

      <para>As long as you have successfully setup NeoStats, and installed it
      correctly, Compiling SecureServ is very simple and straight forward.
      First you must extract the files from the download package. This is as
      simple as:</para>

      <screen>bash$<command> tar -xzf SecureServ-&lt;ver&gt;.tar.gz</command></screen>

      <para>This should then create a directory called
      SecureServ-&lt;version&gt; where &lt;version&gt; is the Version of
      SecureServ. Then Proceed to Change into the SecureServ directory, and
      run Configure as follows:<screen>bash$<command>./configure [--enable-debug | --with-neostats=&lt;dir&gt; --enable-treatchanmsgaspm]</command></screen></para>

      <para>--enable-debug is only useful for diagnostics purposes when used
      in conjunction with debugging tools. There should be no need to use this
      option on a day to day basis</para>

      <para>--with-neostats=&lt;dir&gt; should be used if your neostats
      directory is not in a standard location (~/NeoStats/). Replace
      &lt;dir&gt; with the full path to your NeoStats installation directory
      (NOT SOURCE DIRECTORY)</para>

      <para>--enable-treatchanmsgaspm makes SecureServ treat all messages sent
      to a monitored channel as messages sent to a individual user. Enabling
      this option is not recommended as it greatly increases the CPU
      utilization if you have large, busy channels</para>

      <para>Configuring SecureServ will look something like the following
      screen:</para>

      <screen>Fishs-Mac:~/Documents/Dev/SecureServ justin$ ./configure       
checking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... no
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for gawk... no
checking for mawk... no
checking for nawk... no

&lt;snip&gt;

checking To Enable AutoTools Debug Mode?... no
checking silent building of source files... Enabled
configure: creating ./config.status
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating modconfig.h
config.status: modconfig.h is unchanged
config.status: executing depfiles commands
Configuration complete.
Press Enter key to read the release notes</screen>

      <para>The Configure process will then prompt you to read the release
      notes. You are encouraged to read this document throughly as it might
      contain important information about the current version of SecureServ
      that isn't covered in the manual.</para>

      <para></para>

      <para>If the configuration did not produce a error, you may then move
      onto Compiling SecureServ. Compiling is simply just issuing the "make"
      command (or "gmake" if you are running BSD):</para>

      <screen>Fishs-Mac:~/Documents/Dev/SecureServ justin$ make
make -s all-am
Compiling Helpers.c:                                                  [OK]     
Compiling SecureServ.c:                                               [OK]     
Compiling scan.c:                                                     [OK]     
Compiling OnJoinBot.c:                                                [OK]     
Compiling SecureServ_help.c:                                          [OK]     
Compiling update.c:                                                   [OK] </screen>

      <para>Again, check for Error messages. As long as there are not error
      messages, "make install" will install SecureServ, this README file, and
      any auxiliary files needed into your NeoStats directory:</para>

      <screen>Fishs-Mac:~/Documents/Dev/SecureServ justin$ make install
Installing secureserv.so:                                             [OK]     
Installing viri.dat:                                                  [OK]     
Installing README.SecureServ:                                         [OK]     
Installing README.SecureServ.html:                                    [OK] </screen>

      <para>If you receive *ANY* errors at all during the this process, please
      post them on our Support boards, at
      http//www.neostats.net/boards/</para>

      <para>Once Installation is complete, you can either configure NeoStats
      to load SecureServ when it starts, or load SecureServ via IRC.</para>

      <para>To Configure NeoStats to automatically load SecureServ when it
      boots, modify the neostats.conf file and add SecureServ to the list of
      modules to load:</para>

      <screen>MODULENAME = {
       "statserv",
       "hostserv",
       "secureserv",
} </screen>

      <para>You also should now configure a NeoNet account if you wish to take
      advantage of updated virus definition files. To obtain a account for
      NeoNet, please go to http://accounts.neostats.net and sign up for a new
      account. Once you have signed up, you will recieve a email with
      instructions for configuring your NeoStats to use NeoNet. Please modify
      your neostats.conf file as per the instructions contained in the
      email.</para>

      <para>To load SecureServ via IRC, you must make sure you have the
      appropriate permissions and issue the following command:</para>

      <para><command>/msg neostats load SecureServ</command></para>

      <para>Thats it. SecureServ is now loaded and ready for use (in fact, it
      will already be running now, but read on for further
      information.)</para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Basic Configuration</title>

    <para>SecureServ is completely configured online via IRC. When you first
    start up SecureServ, it attempts some "Sane" defaults for you get started
    with, but you should always review these settings as soon as you install.
    There are a few important settings you may want to review right away. They
    are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Exclusion Lists - You should setup a Exclude list for your IRC
        Services server (NickServ etc)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Automatic or Manual updates of Dat Files</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>System Messages sent to users</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>These are outlined below:</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Exclusion Lists</title>

      <para>Exclusion lists allow you to specify certain Hostmasks, Servers,
      or Channels that should be excluded from monitoring by SecureServ. This
      exclusion list would allow a administrator to say, allow users on that
      are matched against Trojans, when the administrator has verified that
      the Trojan does not in fact exist on the users host.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>Exclusions should be setup for your Services Server, so that
        SecureServ does not try to scan ChanServ, or NickServ, or any of the
        bots relating to Nickname protection.</para>
      </caution>

      <para>With NeoStats 3.0, you should also be aware that there are two
      types of Exclusion Lists. There are "Global" exclusion lists that all
      modules may optionally use, and there is module specific exclusion
      lists. SecureServ defaults to not using the Global Exclusion lists. You
      can enable it by the following command:<screen>/msg SecureServ set exclusions on</screen></para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding a Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Exclusion list, use the following
      format:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude add &lt;host/Server/Channel/UserHost&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;reason&gt;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;Host/Server/Channel/UserHost&gt; = The type of exclusion you
      are adding. The different types are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Host - The Users real (Internet) Hostname</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Server - The Users server they are connecting to. You should
            ensure you add a exclusion for your Services Server</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Channel - A specific channel on your IRC Network</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>UserHost - The users Virtual Hostname (IRC)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>&lt;pattern&gt; = The pattern you wish to match on. May include
      wildcard charactors such as * and ?</para>

      <para>&lt;reason&gt; = a short description of the exclusion, for
      operator reference only.</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>[13:20] -SecureServ- Added *.blah.com (userhost) to exclusion list
[13:20] SecureServ Fish added *.blah.com (userhost) to the exclusion list</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Listing an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the Exclusions simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude list</screen>

      <para>And all the current exclusions are listed. Additionally, a
      Position number is provided for use with the delete command. The output
      is as follows:</para>

      <screen>[13:21]  -SecureServ- Exclusion list:
[13:21]  -SecureServ- #bothouse (Channel) Added by Fish on Sat Aug 13 2005 01:20 AM SGT for Requested

[13:21]  -SecureServ- End of list.</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To delete a entry, you should first lookup the Position of the
      entry that you wish to delete. The format of the command is as
      follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude del &lt;pattern&gt;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;pattern&gt; is the pattern of the entry you wish to delete in
      the list</para>

      <para>The output of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>[13:22]  SecureServ Fish used EXCLUDE
[13:22]  -SecureServ- *.blah.com delete from exclusion list</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Helper Lists</title>

      <para>Helper lists let you grant non-privileged users the ability to
      maintain your Virus help channel and help users that are infected with
      virus's that could be removed with simple instructions (such as Spam
      Virus's that infect Mirc). These users are granted the ability to
      "release" a infected user from SecureServ or kill un-cooperative, or
      unresponsive users that SecureServ has identified as being infected.
      Users that have been joined to the help channel are "held" by SecureServ
      and are usually prevented from joining other channels (if your IRCd
      supports this option). This can be helpful so you can clean up users
      that are infected with simple script based virus's and you require their
      attention to help you clean their computer. More information about the
      commands available to use on infected users is available via the assist
      command detailed below.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>Although SecureServ limits who a "Helper" may kill (only
        infected users joined to the Help Channel) you should only give out
        login accounts to trusted users.</para>
      </caution>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding a Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Helper list, use the following
      format:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ helpers add &lt;login&gt; &lt;pass&gt; </screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;login&gt; = The login name to use to gain access. Does not
      have to be a nickname.</para>

      <para>&lt;pass&gt; = The password to use to login</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&gt;secureserv&lt; helpers add myhelper mypass
-SecureServ- Successfully added Helper myhelper with Password mypass to Helpers List
</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Listing an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the helpers simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ helpers list</screen>

      <para>And all the helpers are listed. Additionally, if a nickname is
      provided after the login name, it means that this nick is logged into
      this particular helper account.</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&gt;secureserv&lt; helpers list
-SecureServ- Helpers List (2):
-SecureServ- fish (Fish)
-SecureServ- myhelper (Not Logged In)
-SecureServ- End of List.
</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To delete a entry, you must provide the login name you wish to
      delete. The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ helpers del &lt;login&gt;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;login&gt; is the login account you wish to delete.</para>

      <para>The output of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&gt;secureserv&lt; helpers del myhelper
-SecureServ- Deleted myhelper from Helpers List
</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Dat File Updates</title>

      <para>In order to update SecureServ's Detection, you need to register a
      account at http://accounts.neostats.net/ and apply for access to the
      Secure IRC-Chat website. Once your application for access has been
      recieved, you will be able to download updated dat files either
      automatically (as they are released) or manually. You also get access to
      some advanced reporting capabilities such as weekly reports on virus
      infections on your Network, as well as real time statistics.</para>

      <para>When applying for access to the Secure IRC-Chat website, it might
      take a while for the application to be approved, as one of the Admins
      has to review the application and ensure its valid. Once your access has
      been granted, you will recieve a email informing you that your access
      has been granted. </para>

      <para>Once you have received confirmation that you can now access Secure
      IRC-Chat via email, you can proceed to configure SecureServ to update
      Dat files automatically for you. SecureServ can be configured to check
      for updates on a Daily Basis. You can, disable this automatic update if
      you wish, but this is covered in the "Settings" Section.</para>

      <para>For more information on the NeoNet configuration, please refer to
      the NeoStats Manual.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>System Messages</title>

      <para>SecureServ sends different messages to users depending on whats
      happening. Examples of the messages its send is messages when they are
      AKILedL or warn a user about a possible "Trojan/Infection" etc. These
      messages can be customized to suit your network, or language of choice
      easily. The different messages that you can set are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>"AKILL" messages</para>

          <para>AKILL messages are sent to users when they are about to be
          akilled from your network due to a positive "infection". You could
          provide email addresses, contact information, should the user wish
          to contact you. In addition to the AKILL message, the user is also
          given a URL they can view with details about their "infection" and
          how to fix it.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>"No Help Available" messages</para>

          <para>As SecureServ can also detect Virus's, some network may have
          channels devoted to helping users remove virus's from their IRC
          clients. SecureServ has a "Helper" login function that allows you to
          setup "non-oper" or "oper" users to be helpers. If no one is logged
          into SecureServ and a virus infected user is detected, instead of
          attempting to automatically join him to the "Help" channel, he is
          akilled from the network. This message is sent to the user to let
          them know that they have a virus, and should seek help.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Setting these three types of messages is simple. Just issue the
      following commands:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set akillmesg &lt;message&gt;</screen>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set nohelpmsg &lt;message&gt;</screen>

      <note>
        <para>If you don't customize any of these messages, a Default system
        message is used automatically.</para>
      </note>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Detailed Configuration</title>

    <para>SecureServ attempts to be as configurable as possible in order to
    cater for each individual networks requirements. This in turn though makes
    the configuration very complex. There are many many settings with
    SecureServ that affect how it operates, how it responds and even, how

      <para>This setting allows you to change the Nickname that SecureServ
      uses when it connects to your network. If you change this setting make
      sure you update your NeoNet account, otherwise you might loose access to
      the Secure IRC-Chat site if we perform a check on your network and can't
      find "SecureServ" running.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>This option requires you to reload SecureServ or restart
        NeoStats to take effect.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>HOST Setting</title>

      <para>This option allows you to customize the Hostname that SecureServ
      uses when it signs onto your Network. It defaults to the Standard
      Hostname specified in your NeoStats configuration.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>This option requires you to reload SecureServ or restart

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>EXCLUSIONS Setting</title>

      <para>This option enables SecureServ to use the Global Exclusions list
      that is control by the main NeoStats bot. This allows you to maintain a
      "global" exclusion list that is applicable to all modules in NeoStats,
      and then only apply individual exclusions to SecureServ. </para>

      <warning>
        <para>This option only becomes effective on new users joining your
        Network. Existing users that are already connected when you enable
        this option will not be rescanned for exclusions, as the Global
        Exclusions are only effected when a new user signs onto the Network.
        In order to make the global exclusions list effective straight away,
        you should restart NeoStats.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>If you wish to enable or disable the Global Exclusions lists,
      issue the following command</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set EXCLUSIONS &lt;ON/OFF&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>VERSION Setting</title>

      <para>When users sign onto your IRC network, SecureServ or NeoStats will
      issue a "CTCP VERSION" command to the clients, as many
      Trojans/WarScripts/Virus's have unique replies to CTCP Version
      requests.</para>

      <para>When SecureServ receives the reply, it compares it to the
      Definitions, and if there is a Match, will take action based on the
      Definition File (Either AKILL the user, Join them to a AV help channel,
      Warn the Operators, or just issue a warning message to the users)</para>

      <para>If you wish to turn off the CTCP VERSION checks, issue the
      following command</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set VERSION &lt;ON/OFF&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>CHECKFIZZER Setting</title>

      <para>SecureServ can Detect the Fizzer Worm on your IRC network. If you
      are not affected by Fizzer, its advisable to turn this option off, as it
      affects performance.</para>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set CHECKFIZZER &lt;ON/OFF&gt; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>DOONJOIN Setting</title>

      <para>This setting decides if SecureServ should perform OnJoin Virus
      Checking. When enabled, every CYCLETIME Seconds, SecureServ will create
      a psydo user and join a random channel. When this setting is off,
      SecureServ will not check random channels for OnJoin Virus's.</para>

      <para>To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set DOONJOIN &lt;ON/OFF&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>ONJOINBOTMODES Setting</title>

      <para>This option defines what usermodes the OnJoin Bots will have when
      they "Sign-On" to your network. By default no modes are assigned, but
      you may wish to assign some Oper or Helper or Services flags so that
      users at least can easily identify that the OnJoinBot is part of your
      services if they Whois the OnJoin Bot</para>

      <para>If you wish to change the modes, issue the following
      command</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set ONJOINBOTMODES &lt;modes&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

      <title>CYCLETIME Setting</title>

      <para>SecureServ automatically creates new "pseudo" users that randomly
      join channels looking for OnJoin virus's or SPAM. This option changes
      the interval that SecureServ will Cycle the random users and channels.
      On a Large network, you should aim for a smaller value, so it covers
      more of your channels quicker, but on a smaller network, this may become
      annoying for your users, so a higher value is recommended.</para>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set CYCLETIME &lt;SECONDS&gt; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>DOPRIVCHAN Setting</title>

      <para>This setting controls if SecureServ's will check Private Channels.
      Private Channels are defined by the Channel Modes +I, +k +s +p or +O.
      Enabling this option forces SecureServ to check these channels.
      Disabling this feature means SecureServ will never check these channels
      unless forced via a /msg SecureServ check &lt;chan&gt;</para>

      <para>To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set DOPRIVCHAN &lt;ON/OFF&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>MULTICHECK Setting</title>

      <para>By Default, when SecureServ identifies a Positive Match for a
      Trojan/VIrus etc, it takes action straight away, and discontinues
      checking for any other matches. This option tells SecureServ, that even
      if it does find a Match, to continue checking, so that the user is
      warned of all matches, and not just the first one found.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Enabling MULTICHECK on a large network is not advised due to
        performance reasons.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set MULTICHECK &lt;ON/OFF&gt; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>MONBOT Setting</title>

      <para>SecureServ has the option to assign one of the random bots to stay
      in a channel all the time, instead of cycling like the ONJOIN bots do.
      This option sets which bot will be used to monitor the channels
      specified in the MONCHAN command. A listing of available bots is
      obtained via the Bots Command. .</para>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set MONBOT &lt;bot&gt; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>MONCHANCYCLE Setting</title>

      <para>This setting specifies if SecureServ should cycle the MONCHAN's
      periodically (by default, it cycles one channel interval specified by
      the MONCHANCYCLETIME setting). This can help detect OnJoin virus's in
      the channels you specify a monitor bot should be placed.</para>

      <para>To Change this setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set MONCHANCYCLE &lt;ON/OFF&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>MONCHANCYCLETIME Setting</title>

      <para>This setting specified the interval that SecureServ will cycle one
      of the monchans. By Default, if MONCHANCYCLE is enabled, every 30
      minutes, one of the MONCHAN's be selected and the monbot will cycle the
      channel looking for ONJOIN virus's. For example, if you are monitoring 4
      channels, each channel will only be cycled every 2 hours (30 minutes x 4
      channels) so you should adjust this value accordingly.</para>

      <para>To Change this setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set MONCHANCYCLETIME &lt;seconds&gt;</screen>
    </sect2>

      <title>BOTECHO Setting</title>

      <para>This option enables SecureServ sending messages any of the onjoin
      bots, or monbot receives to the services channel. This can help you
      monitor for potentially new onjoin virus's, or monitor for spam
      users.</para>

      <para>SecureServ can optionally join the help channel with the first
      helper logs in, and leave the help channel when the last helper logs
      out. No additional functionality is provided when SecureServ joins the
      channel, its only for the "look" and "feel" of having SecureServ in your
      antivirus channel.</para>

      <title>ASSIST Command</title>

      <para>This option is only available to "helpers" that have logged into
      secureserv and is used to control SecureServ's limits over users that
      have been identified as infected with simple virus's and joined to a
      help channel. They allow the "helpers" to either release a user from
      SecureServ's restrictions, or kill un-cooperative, or un-responsive
      users from the network. The helpers may only perform these actions on
      users that SecureServ has identified as infected with a simple virus,
      and automatically joined to the help channel. Helpers may not "kill"
      users that SecureServ has NOT identified as infected.</para>

      <para>The format of the assist command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ assist release/kill &lt;target&gt;</screen>

      <para>The release option allows the user to join all previous channels
      and continue as normal. After release is used on a user, a helper can no
      longer kill the target.</para>

      <para>The kill option removes the user from the network via a akill
      command and broadcasts a message to all opers indicating the helper that
      used the kill command, and the initial virus the users was detected as
      having.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>CHPASS Command</title>

      <para>This option is only available to "helpers" that have logged into
      secureserv and is used to change thier password that they use to login
      to SecureServ. </para>

      <para>The format of the chpass command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ chpass &lt;newpass&gt;</screen>

      <para>newpass = The new password to set your helper account to</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>CHECKCHAN Command</title>

      <para>If you suspect that a user in a Channel is infected with a OnJoin
      virus, you can force SecureServ to check the channel on your behalf. If
      SecureServ finds any infection in the channel, it will take the normal
      action associated with that virus.</para>

      <para>The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ checkchan &lt;chan&gt;
</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>LIST Command</title>

      <para>The List command shows a brief list of all the Definitions that
      SecureServ currently has loaded. These are direct from the Dat file that
      is downloaded from the <link
      linkend="???">http://secure.irc-chat.net</link> website.</para>

      <para>The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ status
</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>MONCHAN Command</title>

      <para>This option allows you to manipulate the list of channels that
      will be monitored all the time by SecureServ for Private Message type
      virus's. The bot that joins these channels is specified in the monbot
      section of the set command. You should also investigate the MONCHANCYCLE
      and MONCHANCYCLETIME options listed above on how to enable the monbot to
      cycle these monitored channels, as a OnJoin bot will not check a MONCHAN
      channel.</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ monchan list</screen>

      <para>This option lists all the channels that will be monitored. If the
      channels do not exist when SecureServ is started, they will be joined
      when the first user joins the channel. When the last user leaves the
      channel, they will also leave the channel.</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ monchan add &lt;chan&gt;</screen>

      <para>This option adds a channel to be monitored.</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ monchan del &lt;chan&gt;</screen>

      <para>This option lists will delete a channel from the monitored
      list.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>BOTS Command</title>

      <para>This option allows you to manipulate the random bot list that is
      used to join random channels (or channels monitored with the monchan
      command, as detailed below). The available options are:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ bots list</screen>

      <para>This option lists all available bots.</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ bots add &lt;nick&gt; &lt;ident&gt; &lt;host&gt; &lt;realname&gt;</screen>

      <para>This option adds a bot with the nickname, ident, host and realname
      as specified in the command to the list of bots that will be used to
      randomly join a channel.</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ bots del &lt;num&gt;</screen>

      <para>This option lists will delete a bot from the available bots if its
      not currently in use.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>CYCLE Command</title>

      <para>This command forces SecureServ to part the existing channel it is
      checking and join the next random Channel.</para>

      <para>The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ cycle</screen>

      <para>The next channel is chosen at random, but is guaranteed not to be
      the previous channel it checked.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>RELOAD Command</title>

      <para>This option reloads the viri.dat and customviri.dat files. Its no
      the same as a update command, as it does not attempt to download new dat
      files from http://secure.irc-chat.net site. Its useful if you make a
      change to your customviri.dat file.</para>

      <para>The format of the reload command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ reload</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>HELPERS Command</title>

      <para>Helper lists let you grant non-privileged users the ability to
      maintain your Virus help channel and help users that are infected with
      virus's that could be removed with simple instructions (such as Spam
      Virus's that infect Mirc). These users are granted the ability to
      "release" a infected user from SecureServ or kill un-cooperative, or
      unresponsive users that SecureServ has identified as being infected.
      Users that have been joined to the help channel are "held" by SecureServ
      and are usually prevented from joining other channels (if your IRCd
      supports this option). This can be helpful so you can clean up users
      that are infected with simple script based virus's and you require their
      attention to help you clean their computer. More information about the
      commands available to use on infected users is available via the assist
      command detailed below.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>Although SecureServ limits who a "Helper" may kill (only
        infected users joined to the Help Channel) you should only give out
        login accounts to trusted users.</para>
      </caution>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding a Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Helper list, use the following
      format:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ helpers add &lt;login&gt; &lt;pass&gt; </screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;login&gt; = The login name to use to gain access. Does not
      have to be a nickname.</para>

      <para>&lt;pass&gt; = The password to use to login</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&gt;secureserv&lt; helpers add myhelper mypass
-SecureServ- Successfully added Helper myhelper with Password mypass to Helpers List
</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Listing an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the helpers simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ helpers list</screen>

      <para>And all the helpers are listed. Additionally, if a nickname is
      provided after the login name, it means that this nick is logged into
      this particular helper account.</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&gt;secureserv&lt; helpers list
-SecureServ- Helpers List (2):
-SecureServ- fish (Fish)
-SecureServ- myhelper (Not Logged In)
-SecureServ- End of List.
</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To delete a entry, you must provide the login name you wish to
      delete. The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ helpers del &lt;login&gt;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;login&gt; is the login account you wish to delete.</para>

      <para>The output of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&gt;secureserv&lt; helpers del myhelper
-SecureServ- Deleted myhelper from Helpers List
</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>EXCLUDE Command</title>

      <para>Exclusion lists allow you to specify certain Hostmasks, Servers,
      or Channels that should be excluded from monitoring by SecureServ. This
      exclusion list would allow a administrator to say, allow users on that
      are matched against Trojans, when the administrator has verified that
      the Trojan does not in fact exist on the users host.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>Exclusions should be setup for your Services Server, so that
        SecureServ does not try to scan ChanServ, or NickServ, or any of the
        bots relating to Nickname protection.</para>
      </caution>

      <para>With NeoStats 3.0, you should also be aware that there are two
      types of Exclusion Lists. There are "Global" exclusion lists that all
      modules may optionally use, and there is module specific exclusion
      lists. SecureServ defaults to not using the Global Exclusion lists. You
      can enable it by the following command:<screen>/msg SecureServ set exclusions on</screen></para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding a Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Exclusion list, use the following
      format:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude add &lt;host/Server/Channel/UserHost&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;reason&gt;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;Host/Server/Channel/UserHost&gt; = The type of exclusion you
      are adding. The different types are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Host - The Users real (Internet) Hostname</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Server - The Users server they are connecting to. You should
            ensure you add a exclusion for your Services Server</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Channel - A specific channel on your IRC Network</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>UserHost - The users Virtual Hostname (IRC)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>&lt;pattern&gt; = The pattern you wish to match on. May include
      wildcard charactors such as * and ?</para>

      <para>&lt;reason&gt; = a short description of the exclusion, for
      operator reference only.</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>[13:20] -SecureServ- Added *.blah.com (userhost) to exclusion list
[13:20] SecureServ Fish added *.blah.com (userhost) to the exclusion list</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Listing an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the Exclusions simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude list</screen>

      <para>And all the current exclusions are listed. Additionally, a
      Position number is provided for use with the delete command. The output
      is as follows:</para>

      <screen>[13:21]  -SecureServ- Exclusion list:
[13:21]  -SecureServ- #bothouse (Channel) Added by Fish on Sat Aug 13 2005 01:20 AM SGT for Requested

[13:21]  -SecureServ- End of list.</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To delete a entry, you should first lookup the Position of the
      entry that you wish to delete. The format of the command is as
      follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude del &lt;pattern&gt;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&lt;pattern&gt; is the pattern of the entry you wish to delete in
      the list</para>

      <para>The output of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>[13:22]  SecureServ Fish used EXCLUDE
[13:22]  -SecureServ- *.blah.com delete from exclusion list</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>UPDATE Command</title>

      <para>That command forces SecureServ to check the Dat File version at
      <link linkend="???">http://secure.irc-chat.net/</link> and download the
      latest version if required.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Repeated use of this command in a short period of time will
        result in your account at secure.irc-chat.net being suspended for
        abuse. Use with CARE</para>
      </warning>

      <para>The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ update</screen>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Custom Definitions</title>

    <para>You can create your own definitions to be used by SecureServ, but it
    requires a bit of programing skill, and knowledge of how to detect the
    trojan/virus.</para>

    <para>We have enabled SecureServ to obtain additional definitions from a
    custom, administrator defined definition file. This allows IRC
    administrators to add additional signatures to SecureServ to ban clients
    that the IRC network does not permit. A common signature is one for
    Bottlers or IRCork clients. The only drawback is that the definition file
    is not simple, and some degree of programing knowledge is required.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Custom Definitions file</title>

      <para>If you wish to create your own custom definition, follow these
      steps:</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Create customviri.dat file</title>

        <para>with a text editor, create a new file called customviri.dat in
        your ~/NeoStats/data directory.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>add entries to customviri.dat</title>

        <para>The format of the customviri.dat file is as follows:</para>

        <example>
          <title>customvir.dat</title>

          <para><emphasis>name</emphasis> <emphasis>dettype</emphasis> 0 0
          "<emphasis>detectionregex</emphasis>" "<emphasis>message</emphasis>"
          <emphasis>action</emphasis></para>

          <para>It is very important that you follow the spacing format,
          otherwise your custom definition will fail to load.</para>

          <para>Each individual field is described below:</para>

          <para><emphasis
          role="bold"><varname>name</varname></emphasis></para>

          <para>This is the Virus Name. It can be any combination of upper and
          lower case characters or numbers, but can not contain spaces, or
          punctuation.</para>

          <para><emphasis
          role="bold"><varname>dettype</varname></emphasis></para>

          <para>This defines how SecureServ should use this signature to
          detect Trojans. Its a number and can only be one of the
          following:</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>0 - CTCP Version
          check.</type></emphasis> This trys to match the detectionregex
          against a received CTCP version reply.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>1 - Private Message.</type>
          </emphasis>This trys to match the detectionregex against a private

          This is reserved.</para>

          <para><emphasis
          role="bold"><varname>detectionregex</varname></emphasis></para>

          <para>This field is used to define how to detect a Trojan. If for
          example in the dettype we specify a value of 0, then this is a
          regular expression that is applied to all CTCP VERSION replies that
          secureserv receives. <warning>
              <para>This is a "Regular Expression" field. It is not the same
              as a wildcard field. Regular expressions are much more powerful
              pattern matching expressions than the standard ? and * options
              available in typical filesystem or IRC pattern matching code. If
              you have never used regular expression before, I STRONGLY
              suggest you test your "Regular expression" code with a utility
              called "pcretest" available as part of libpcre at www.pcre.org.
              Additionally, you should try to learn the pattern matching
              language. This can be done by looking at the man page for
              "perlre" or the documentation available on www.pcre.org. If you
              get your pattern matching code wrong, you have the ability to
              kill everyone on your IRC network, so be extremely
              careful.</para>

          <para>This is the private message sent to the "Infected" user when
          they are matched against this definition. As customviri.dat
          definitions do not direct users to the secure.irc-chat.net. site,
          you should provide as much information as possible in this, or
          optionally, direct them to your own hosted IRC page. You should
          place your message inside double quotation marks (") and if you use
          " in your regular expression, you must escape them.</para>

          <para><emphasis
          role="bold"><varname>action</varname></emphasis></para>

          <para>This field defines what SecureServ should do when it matches a
          user against this definition. The field is a number only and should
          only be one of the following.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>0 - SVSJOIN.</type></emphasis> On
          IRCds that support SVSJOIN, the user is automatically joined to the
          help channel, and any online opers are notified of the users
          infection. If no helpers are logged in, then the user is akilled
          instead.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>1 - AKILL.</type></emphasis> Akill
          the user from the IRC network.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>2 - WARN.</type></emphasis> Send
          the message to the user indicating they matched a definition, warn
          the operators via a global message, and do nothing else.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>3 - NOTHING.</type></emphasis>
          Only send the message to the user. Do not take any further
          action.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold"><type>3 - KILL.</type></emphasis> just
          issue a standard kill message for the infected user</para>

          <para>We don't support any customviri.dat definitions, either by the
          secure.irc-chat.net site, or via our boards, though members of the
          community may choose to share their customviri.dat files. If you are
          in doubt or unsure about creating your own customviri.dat files you
          should always test them with the warn or nothing option as the
          action type until you are sure that you have the matching
          correct.</para>

        <title>Reload the definitions</title>

        <para>If SecureServ is already operating, you can reload the
        definitions by issuing a /msg SecureServ reload command. This will
        make SecureServ reload both the viri.dat file as well as the
        customviri.dat file. Your customviri.dat entries will be placed before
        any viri.dat entries, so if you wish to override the action of a
        viri.dat entry, you can place a copy in the customviri.dat
        file.</para>

      <title>Dealing with Un-detected Attacks/Trojans/Virus etc</title>

      <para>If you come across a new "Trojan" or Virus or attack on your
      network, it might be possible to update SecureServ to be able to detect
      these new "Virus's"</para>

      <para>If you wish us to consider adding support to SecureServ's
      Definition files for new "Virus's" please provide us with the following
      information via http://secure.irc-chat.net/ using the "submit new" link
      (only available when logged in as a member)</para>

      <para>The following information is required:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the output from /whois &lt;infected user&gt;</para>

          <para>If there are multiple Infected users, please provide multiple
          /whois outputs. This will aid us in determining a pattern.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The results from a /ctcp &lt;infected user&gt; version
          command, if any</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Logfiles extracts of the behavior of the bot that makes you
          suspect it is a new Trojan/Virus</para>

          <para>we will NOT add detection to SecureServ for anything we can
          not verify is in fact a risk to IRC security. If you submit to us
          the details of a script that a user is using, because you don't like
          the colors, Tough. Find some other way to deal with that
          user.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Details of your IRC network</para>

          <para>So that we may contact you directly on your network if we
          require additional information or wish to the "Virus" in the
          wild.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Before adding new items to the Definitions, we do as much research
      as possible, and also share this information with other "IRC Security"
      professionals or teams in order to determine the most effective way to
      detect this "infection"</para>

      <para>Additionally, we will add "warning" messages to users that are
      running old copies of IRC software that are vulnerable to security
      issues (such as allows a Hacker to break into the users computer via
      IRC) and advise the user to upgrade their IRC client. If you are a
      client Author of a script or IRC client that has had Security Issues in
      the past, and wish us to add this "warning" to the Definitions, please
      contact us directly.</para>
