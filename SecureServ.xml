  <title>SecureServ Manual</title>

  <para>Welcome to the SecureServ Manual. This document will aid you in
  setting up and running SercureServ on your IRC network.</para>

  <para>SecureServ is a advanced IRC Trojan detector, much like a Virus
  Scanner, but aimed for IRC networks. Using Several different methods,
  including, but not limited to Version checks, Behavior analysis, and general
  pattern matching, it aims to detect Trojans and Virus&#39;s as well as
  FloodBots that connect to your IRC network.</para>

  <para>SecureServ&#39;s &#34;brains&#34; are based on a &#34;Definition
  file&#34; or Dat file, that contain information on how to detect the
  trojans. This means to update SecureServ&#39;s detection for new
  Trojans/Bots only requires that you download a new dat file (which can be
  automated). There are some pre-conditions to obtaining new Dat files, and
  these can be found in the Installation chapter.</para>

  <para>SecureServ can detect Trojan/Virus&#39;s or &#34;Security Risks&#34;
  to your Network a number of ways, including:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>CTCP Version Checks</para>
    </listitem>

  </itemizedlist>

  <para>While we can detect a vast majority of Trojans, and its easy to extend
  SecureServ to detect new ones without Recompiling/upgrading, its not a
  fullproof solution. Additionally, Virus/Trojan/Bot authors are getting more
  and more sophisticated these days, and will always find ways to avoid
  detection. SecureServ aims to reduce the load on a Network Administration
  staff in dealing with these Trojans.</para>

  <warning>
    <para>As of writting, this software is BETA quality. Not all functionality
    has been implemented, and additionally, there might be some &#34;BAD&#34;
    bugs in SecureServ that cause it to AKILL your entire network. Our testing
    and Development of SecureServ was run on a 1500 user network, and so far,
    has proved stable, and effective in protecting our network, BUT every
    users enviroment is different. While we have taken all precautions and
    conducted a extensive QA cycle before the release of SecureServ, its a
    &#34;Use at your Own Risk&#34; Module. Of Course, if you do have bad
    experiences with SecureServ, please let us know at <link linkend="???">http://www.neostats.net/boards/</link></para>
  </warning>

  <para>SecureServ is written and maintained by Justin Hammond. It requires
  the NeoStats software. More information about SecureServ, or NeoStats, can
  be found at <link linkend="???">http://www.neostats.net/</link></para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Prerequisites and Installation.</title>

    <para>SecureServ is designed to run on Top of NeoStats. The Following
    requirements at the time of writting are required for NeoStats:<itemizedlist><listitem><para>A
    Linux or BSD based Server or Shell.</para></listitem><listitem><para>A
    supported IRCd. Currently, Hybrid7, Unreal, Ultimate2.x or Ultimate3.x or
    NeoIRCd</para></listitem><listitem><para>Some basic Unix administration
    Skill</para></listitem><listitem><para>Of Course, a IRC network to connect
    it all together.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></para>

    <para>Please refer to the NeoStats website for more information on the
    requirements</para>

    <para>SecureServ itself requires the following:<itemizedlist><listitem><para>NeoStats
    2.5.3 or Higher correctly installed and Running</para></listitem><listitem><para>Libpcre
    (tested with version 3.9)</para></listitem><listitem><para>A account on
    <link linkend="???">http://secure.irc-chat.net</link> is required if you
    wish to take advantage of updated definition files</para></listitem><listitem><para>The
    time to read this entire document. <warning><para>SecureServ has the
    potential to Akill/Gline your entire network. Its strongly suggested that
    you read this entire document before even attempting to compile
    SecureServ, as I&#39;m just going to laugh, if you didn&#39;t read, and it
    AKILL&#39;s your entire network. This is Beta Software, there are BUGS.
    beware.</para></warning></para></listitem></itemizedlist></para>

    <para>The requirement to have a valid account on <link linkend="???">http://secure.irc-chat.net</link>
    is due to the fact that I want to have some control over who recieves the
    definition files. If these Definition files fall into the hands of the
    TrojanWritters or Virus Writers, its possible they might be able to
    re-write their bots to avoid detection. Please see the website for more
    information.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Compiling and Installation</title>

      <para>As long as you have successfully setup NeoStats, and installed it
      correctly, Compiling SecureServ is very simple and straight forward.
      First you must extract the files from the download package. This is as
      simple as:</para>

      <screen>bash$<command> tar -xzf SecureServ-&#60;ver&#62;.tar.gz</command></screen>

      <para>This should then create a directory called
      SecureServ-&#60;version&#62; where &#60;version&#62; is the Version of
      SecureServ. Then Proceed to Change into the SecureServ directory, and
      run Configure as follows:<screen>bash$<command>./configure [--enable-debug | --with-neostats=&#60;dir&#62;]</command></screen></para>

      <para>--enable-debug is only usefull for diagnostics purposes when used
      in conjuction with debugging tools. There should be no need to use this
      option on a day to day basis</para>

      <para>--with-neostats=&#60;dir&#62; should be used if your neostats
      directory is not in a standard location (~/NeoStats/). Replace
      &#60;dir&#62; with the full path to your NeoStats installation directory
      (NOT SOURCE DIRECTORY)</para>

      <para>Configuring SecureServ will look something like the following
      screen:</para>

      <screen>[Fish@fish-dt]$ ./configure

      <para>If the configuration did not produce a error, you may then move
      onto Compiling SecureServ. Compiling is simply just issuing the
      &#34;make&#34; command (or &#34;gmake&#34; if you are running BSD):</para>

      <screen>[Fish@fish-dt]$ make
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. SecureServ.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. SecureServ_help.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. http.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. OnJoinBot.c

ld -shared -o SecureServ.so  SecureServ.o SecureServ_help.o http.o OnJoinBot.o FloodCheck.o -L/usr/lib -lpcre
</screen>

      <para>Again, check for Error messages. As long as there are not error
      messages, &#34;make install&#34; will install SecureServ, this README
      file, and any auxiluary files needed into your NeoStats directory:</para>

      <screen>[Fish@fish-dt]$ make install
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 SecureServ.so  /home/fish/NeoStats//dl/
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 README.SecureServ SecureServ.settings /home/fish/NeoStats//dl/../doc/
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 viri.dat /home/fish/NeoStats//dl/../data/
</screen>

      <para>If you recieve *ANY* errors at all during the this process, please
      post them on our Support boards, at http//www.neostats.net/boards/</para>

      <para>Once Installation is complete, you can either configure NeoStats
      to load SecureServ when it starts, or load SecureServ via IRC.</para>

      <para>To Configure NeoStats to automatically load SecureServ when it
      boots, add the following line to your &#34;neostats.cfg&#34; file in the
      NeoStats directory:</para>

      <para><command>LOAD_MODULE SecureServ</command></para>

      <para>To load SecureServ via IRC, you must make sure you have the
      appropriate permissions and issue the following command:</para>

      <para><command>/msg neostats load SecureServ</command></para>

      <para>Thats it. SecureServ is now loaded and ready for use (in fact, it
      will already be running now, but read on for futher information.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Basic Configuration</title>

    <para>SecureServ is completly configured online via IRC. When you first
    start up SecureServ, it attempts some &#34;Sane&#34; defaults for you get
    started with, but you should always review these settings as soon as you
    install. There are a few important settings you may want to review right
    away. They are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Exclusion Lists - You should setup a Exclude list for your IRC
        Services server (NickServ etc)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Username and Password for Dat File Updates</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>System Messages sent to users</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>These are outlined below:</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Exclusion Lists</title>

      <para>Exclusion lists allow you to specify certian Hostmasks, Servers,
      or Channels that should be excluded from monitoring by SecureServ. This
      exclusion list would allow a administrator to say, allow users on that
      are matched against trojans, when the administrator has verified that
      the trojan does not in fact exist on the users host. Additionally,</para>

      <caution>
        <para>Exclusions should be setup for your Services Server, so that
        SecureServ does not try to scan ChanServ, or NickServ, or any of the
        bots relating to Nickname protection.</para>
      </caution>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adding a Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To add a entry to the Exclusion list, use the following format:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude add &#60;host/Server/Channel&#62; &#60;type&#62; &#60;reason&#62;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&#60;host&#62; = The HostName/Server or Channel name. WildCards ?
      and * are permitted.</para>

      <para>&#60;type&#62; = The type of exclusion. 0 is for HostNames, 1 is
      for Servers, and 2 is for channels.</para>

      <para>&#60;reason&#62; = a short description of the exclusion, for
      operator reference only.</para>

      <para>The output is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;secureserv&#60; exclude add #chan 2 Blah is my reason
-SecureServ- Added #chan (Channel) exception to list</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Listing an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To list the Exclusions simple type:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude list</screen>

      <para>And all the current exclusions are listed. Additionaly, a Position
      number is provided for use with the delete command. The output is as
      follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;secureserv&#60; exclude list
-SecureServ- Exception List:
-SecureServ- 1) *.blah.com (Server) Added by Fish for Blah is my reason
-SecureServ- 2) is.blah.com (HostName) Added by Fish for can by high
-SecureServ- 3) #chan (Channel) Added by Fish for Blah is my reason
-SecureServ- End of List.</screen>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting an Entry</emphasis></para>

      <para>To delete a entry, you should first lookup the Position of the
      entry that you wish to delete. The format of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ exclude del &#60;num&#62;</screen>

      <para>Where:</para>

      <para>&#60;num&#62; is the position of the entry you wish to delete in
      the list</para>

      <para>The output of the command is as follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;secureserv&#60; exclude del 1
-SecureServ- Deleted #chan Channel out of exception list</screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Username and Password for Dat File Updates</title>

      <para>In order to update SecureServ&#39;s Detection, you need to
      register for a account at http://secure.irc-chat.net/ Once you have
      recieved your username and password via email, you can proceed to
      configure SecureServ to update Dat files automatically for you.
      SecureServ can be configured to check for updates on a Daily Basis. You
      can, disable this automatic update if you wish, but this is covered in
      the &#34;Settings&#34; Section.</para>

      <para>Once you have recieved your username and password, Issue the
      following command to SecureServ:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set updateinfo &#60;username&#62; &#60;password&#62;</screen>

      <para>The output should be as follows:</para>

      <screen>&#62;SecureServ&#60; set updateinfo myusername myl33tpassword
-SecureServ- Update Username and Password has been updated to myusername and myl33tpassword</screen>

      <para>You can then issue the following command to check that the
      username and password are correct and also, update your dat file to the
      latest version automatically:</para>

      <screen>/msg secureserv update</screen>

      <para>If all goes well, SecureServ should respond with:</para>

      <screen>&#62;SecureServ&#60; update
-SecureServ- Requesting New Dat File. Please Monitor the Services Channel for Success/Failure
&#60;SecureServ&#62;/#services Fish requested a update to the Dat file
&#60;SecureServ&#62;/#ervices DatFile Version 32 has been downloaded and installed</screen>

      <para>If the update failed for any reason, you will either not recieve
      any message about DatFile being downloaded and installed, or will
      recieve a message detailing the problem.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>System Messages</title>

      <para>SecureServ sends different messages to users depending on whats
      happening. Examples of the messages its send is a &#34;Warning
      message&#34; to users that they are about to be checked for Virus&#39;s,
      and also messages when they AKILL or warn a user about a possible
      &#34;Trojan/Infection&#34; etc. These messages can be customized to suit
      your network, or language of choice easily. The different messages that
      you can set are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>&#34;Greeting&#34; messages</para>

          <para>Greeting Messages are sent to uses when they sign on your
          Network. They are just to inform the user that a CTCP VERSION check
          is being conducted.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>&#34;AKILL&#34; messages</para>

          <para>AKILL messages are sent to users when they are about to be
          akilled from your network due to a positive &#34;infection&#34;. You
          could provide email addresses, contact information, should the user
          wish to contact you. In addition to the AKILL message, the user is
          also given a URL they can view with details about their
          &#34;infection&#34; and how to fix it.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>&#34;No Help Available&#34; messages</para>

          <para>As SecureServ can also detect Virus&#39;s, some network may
          have channels devoted to helping users remove virus&#39;s from their
          IRC clients. SecureServ has a &#34;Helper&#34; login function that
          allows you to setup &#34;non-oper&#34; or &#34;oper&#34; users to be
          helpers. If no one is logged into SecureServ and a virus infected
          user is detected, instead of attempting to automatically join him to
          the &#34;Help&#34; channel, he is akilled from the network. This
          message is sent to the user to let them know that they have a virus,
          and should seek help.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Setting these three types of messages is simple. Just issue the
      following commands:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set signonmsg &#60;message&#62;</screen>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set akillmesg &#60;message&#62;</screen>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set nohelpmsg &#60;message&#62;</screen>

      <note>
        <para>If you don&#39;t customize any of these messages, a Default
        system message is used automatically.</para>
      </note>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Detailed Configuration</title>

    <para>SecureServ attempts to be as configurable as possible in order to
    cater for each individual networks requirements. This in turn though makes
    the configuration very complex. There are many many settings with
    SecureServ that affect how it operates, how it responds and even, how
    affects the performance of NeoStats Overall. Out of the box, SecureServ
    provides sensible defaults for these settings, but you may wish to read
    this section for details on exactly what each option does, and its affect
    on how SecureServ operates.</para>

    <para>The following list summaries the available Options you can set in
    SecureServ</para>

    <para>To change any of these settings, you use the Set Interface in
    SecureServ. Eg:</para>

    <screen>/msg SecureServ set &#60;option&#62; &#60;params&#62;</screen>

    <para>To view the current settings, issue the following command:</para>

    <screen>/msg SecureServ set list</screen>

    <para>The following Sections describes the different options, their
    params, and the effect on SecureServ in detail.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>SPLILTTIME Setting</title>

      <para>SecureServ Monitors the number of joins on a Channel in order to
      determine if the channel is been attacked by FloodBots. In Order for
      SecureServ to help Determine what is a FloodBot attack, and what might
      be a simple Net-Join, it exaimes the time the user signed on IRC. This
      value determines how long a user must be on IRC before its determined
      that their channel join is not part of a &#34;FloodBot&#34; attack.</para>

      <para>The default setting for this option is 300 Seconds (5 Minutes,
      which, in most cases, is ideal for most networks. You should not need to
      change this value.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>If you set this value to high, then during a netjoin (when 2
        split servers rejoin) SecureServ may determine that the users coming
        back from the Split are FloodBots and Close down Channels. Be carefull
        with modifing this value.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>To Change the setting, issue the following Command:</para>

      <screen>/msg SecureServ set SPLITTIME &#60;seconds&#62; </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>VERSION Setting</title>

      <para>When users sign onto your IRC network, SecureServ issues a
      &#34;CTCP VERSION&#34; command to the clients, as many
      Trojans/WarScripts/Virus&#39;s have unique replies to CTCP Version
      requests.</para>

      option changes the interval that SecureServ will Cycle the random users
      and channels. On a Large network, you should aim for a smaller value, so
      it covers more of your channels quicker, but on a smaller network, this
      may become annoying for your users, so a higher value is recomended.</para>

      <title>Dealing with Un-detected Attacks/Trojans/Virus etc</title>

      <para>If you come across a new &#34;Trojan&#34; or Virus or attack on
      your network, it might be possible to update SecureServ to be able to
      detect these new &#34;Virus&#39;s&#34;</para>

      <para>If you wish us to consider adding support to SecureServ&#39;s
      Definition files for new &#34;Virus&#39;s&#34; please provide us with
      the following information via http://secure.irc-chat.net/ using the
      &#34;submit new&#34; link (only available when logged in as a member)</para>

      <para>The following information is required:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>the output from /whois &#60;infected user&#62;</para>

          <para>If there are multiple Infected users, please provide multiple

          <para>we will NOT add detection to SecureServ for anything we can
          not verify is in fact a risk to IRC security. If you submit to us

      <para>Before adding new items to the Definitions, we do as much research
      as possible, and also share this information with other &#34;IRC
      Security&#34; professionals or teams in order to determine the most
      effective way to detect this &#34;infection&#34;</para>

      <para>Additionally, we will add &#34;warning&#34; messages to users that
      are running old copies of IRC software that are vulnerable to security
      issues (such as allows a Hacker to break into the users computer via
      IRC) and advise the user to upgrade their IRC client. If you are a
      client Author of a script or IRC client that has had Security Issues in
      the past, and wish us to add this &#34;warning&#34; to the Defintions,
      please contact us directly.</para>

      <title>Customizing the Definitions file</title>

      <para>While we have taken care to make sure that you can control what
      happens when a &#34;Virus&#34; is detected, there isn&#39;t much control
      left to the Administrator to control what is Detected.</para>

      <para>We are currently working on extensions to the
      http://secure.irc-chat.net/ website that will allow you to control what
      &#34;Virus&#39;s&#34; will be placed in the definitions file for your
      copy of SecureServ. Unfortuantly implementing this feature is rather
      complex and requires a great deal of coding on our site to implement. In
      the mean time, we will shortly be releasing a Windows Binary file that
      will allow you to grab the latest version of the Dat files from the
      website, and customize them. Installation of the &#34;Customized&#34;
      version will require a restart, and you will not be able to use the
      &#34;Automatic Update&#34; features.</para>
