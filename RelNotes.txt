SecureServ 0.9.4 Release Notes - 20/8/2003
========================================
THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE. YOU ARE WARNED.

- Only BugFixes in this release, nothing new.

- SecureServ at the moment does not prevent users that are joined to the
  help channel from joining other channels. This will be fixed in the next
  version. 

- NickFlood Code has been implemented, but not enforced. You will get
  messages in your services channel if SecureServ detects NickFloods, but it
  wont actually do anything (yet)

- If you wish to take advantage of updated Definition files, you *MUST*
  apply for a account at http://secure.irc-chat.net/ (currently 99
  Signatures, and due to grow even bigger shortly after this release)

- A LOT OF NEW OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS RELEASE. READ THE README FILE.
  IF YOU ASK A QUESTION THATS ANSWERED IN THE README FILE ON THE BOARDS, YOU
  WONT GET A ANSWER FROM ME!!!
