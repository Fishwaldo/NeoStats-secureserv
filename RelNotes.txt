SecureServ 1.0 Release Notes - 21/11/2003
========================================
- SecureServ now supports a Custom Virus definition file. Read the manual
  for more details

- SecureServ will now optionally invite users to the help channel if the
  definitions say to do a SVSJOIN, but the IRCd does not support SVSJOIN

- If you wish to take advantage of updated Definition files, you *MUST*
  apply for a account at http://secure.irc-chat.net/ (currently 140+
  Signatures, and due to grow even bigger shortly after this release)

- A new option, /msg SecureServ set botecho on will now echo any messages
  the onjoin bots, or monbot recieves to the services channel, regardless of
  the verbose settting.
