   6. Final Words

        6.1. Dealing with Un-detected Attacks/Trojans/Virus etc

   Welcome  to  the  SecureServ  Manual.  This  document  will aid you in
   setting up and running SercureServ on your IRC network.

   SecureServ  is  a  advanced  IRC  Trojan  detector,  much like a Virus
   Scanner,  but aimed for IRC networks. Using Several different methods,
   including,  but  not limited to Version checks, Behavior analysis, and
   general  pattern  matching,  it  aims to detect Trojans and Virus's as
   well as FloodBots that connect to your IRC network.

   SecureServ's  "brains"  are  based on a "Definition file" or Dat file,
   that  contain  information on how to detect the trojans. This means to
   update  SecureServ's detection for new Trojans/Bots only requires that
   you  download  a new dat file (which can be automated). There are some
   pre-conditions  to  obtaining new Dat files, and these can be found in
   the Installation chapter.

   Additionally,  with  1.0  version  of  SecureServ,  we  now  support a
   "customised" dat file that administrators can add their own signatures
   to to help detect new, or unsupported clients/trojans. (eg, Bottlers).
   This  requires  some  programing knowledge, and more information about
   the  customviri.dat  file  can  be  found  in the "Custom Definitions"
   chapter.

   SecureServ  can  detect  Trojan/Virus's  or  "Security  Risks" to your
   Network a number of ways, including:
     * CTCP Version Checks
     * NickName Patterns
     * UserName (Ident) Patterns
     * RealName Patterns
     * Channel MemberShip Patterns
     * Private/Notice Messages
     * Channel Utilization
     * Logic Checks

   While we can detect a vast majority of Trojans, and its easy to extend
   SecureServ to detect new ones without Recompiling/upgrading, its not a
   fullproof solution. Additionally, Virus/Trojan/Bot authors are getting
   more  and  more sophisticated these days, and will always find ways to
   avoid  detection.  SecureServ  aims  to  reduce  the load on a Network
   Administration staff in dealing with these Trojans.

   SecureServ  is  written  and maintained by Justin Hammond. It requires
   the NeoStats software. More information about SecureServ, or NeoStats,
   can be found at http://www.neostats.net/

   SecureServ is Copyright, 2004 by Justin Hammond.

1. Prerequisites and Installation.

   SecureServ  is  designed  to  run  on  Top  of NeoStats. The Following
   requirements at the time of writing are required for NeoStats:
     * A Linux or BSD based Server or Shell.
     * A  supported  IRCd.  Currently,  Hybrid7,  Unreal,  Ultimate2.x or
       Ultimate3.x or NeoIRCd
     * Some basic Unix administration Skill
     * Of Course, a IRC network to connect it all together.

   Please  refer  to  the  NeoStats  website  for more information on the
   requirements

   SecureServ itself requires the following:
     * NeoStats 2.5.9 or Higher correctly installed and Running
     * A account on http://secure.irc-chat.net is required if you wish to
       take advantage of updated definition files
     * The time to read this entire document.

Warning
       SecureServ  has  the potential to Akill/Gline your entire network.
       Its  strongly  suggested that you read this entire document before
       even attempting to compile SecureServ, as I'm just going to laugh,
       if you didn't read, and it AKILL's your entire network.

   The  requirement to have a valid account on http://secure.irc-chat.net
   is  due to the fact that I want to have some control over who receives
   the definition files. If these Definition files fall into the hands of
   the  TrojanWritters  or Virus Writers, its possible they might be able
   to  re-write their bots to avoid detection. Please see the website for
   more information.

1.1. Compiling and Installation

   As  long  as  you  have  successfully setup NeoStats, and installed it
   correctly,  Compiling  SecureServ is very simple and straight forward.
   First you must extract the files from the download package. This is as
   simple as:
bash$ tar -xzf SecureServ-<ver>.tar.gz

   This  should then create a directory called SecureServ-<version> where
   <version>  is  the  Version of SecureServ. Then Proceed to Change into
   the SecureServ directory, and run Configure as follows:
bash$./configure [--enable-debug | --with-neostats=<dir>]

   --enable-debug  is  only  useful for diagnostics purposes when used in
   conjunction  with debugging tools. There should be no need to use this
   option on a day to day basis

   --with-neostats=<dir> should be used if your neostats directory is not
   in a standard location (~/NeoStats/). Replace <dir> with the full path
   to your NeoStats installation directory (NOT SOURCE DIRECTORY)

   Configuring SecureServ will look something like the following screen:
[Fish@fish-dt]$ ./configure
checking for gcc... gcc
checking for C compiler default output... a.out
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
checking whether we are cross compiling... no
checking for suffix of executables...

checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
checking for gcc option to accept ANSI C... none needed

(*----------------------------------------------------------*)

   If  the  configuration did not produce a error, you may then move onto
   Compiling  SecureServ.  Compiling  is  simply  just issuing the "make"
   command (or "gmake" if you are running BSD):
[Fish@fish-dt]$ make
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. Secure
Serv.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. Secure
Serv_help.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. http.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. OnJoin
Bot.c
gcc -c -O2 -Wall -I/usr/include/pcre -I/home/fish/NeoStats//include/ -I. FloodC
heck.c
ld -shared -o SecureServ.so  SecureServ.o SecureServ_help.o http.o OnJoinBot.o
FloodCheck.o -L/usr/lib -lpcre

   Again,  check  for  Error  messages.  As  long  as there are not error
   messages,  "make  install"  will install SecureServ, this README file,
   and any auxiliary files needed into your NeoStats directory:
[Fish@fish-dt]$ make install
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 SecureServ.so  /home/fish/NeoStats//dl/
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 README.SecureServ SecureServ.settings /home/fish/Neo
Stats//dl/../doc/
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 viri.dat /home/fish/NeoStats//dl/../data/

   If  you  receive  *ANY*  errors at all during the this process, please
   post them on our Support boards, at http//www.neostats.net/boards/

   Once  Installation  is  complete, you can either configure NeoStats to
   load SecureServ when it starts, or load SecureServ via IRC.

   To  Configure NeoStats to automatically load SecureServ when it boots,
   add  the  following  line  to your "neostats.cfg" file in the NeoStats
   directory:

   LOAD_MODULE SecureServ

   To  load  SecureServ  via  IRC,  you  must  make  sure  you  have  the
   appropriate permissions and issue the following command:

   /msg neostats load SecureServ

   Thats it. SecureServ is now loaded and ready for use (in fact, it will
   already be running now, but read on for further information.

2. Basic Configuration

   SecureServ  is  completely  configured  online via IRC. When you first
   start  up  SecureServ,  it  attempts  some "Sane" defaults for you get
   started  with,  but you should always review these settings as soon as
   you install. There are a few important settings you may want to review
   right away. They are:
     * Exclusion  Lists  -  You  should setup a Exclude list for your IRC
       Services server (NickServ etc)
     * Username and Password for Dat File Updates
     * System Messages sent to users

   These are outlined below:

2.1. Exclusion Lists

   Exclusion  lists  allow  you to specify certain Hostmasks, Servers, or
   Channels  that  should be excluded from monitoring by SecureServ. This
   exclusion list would allow a administrator to say, allow users on that
   are  matched against Trojans, when the administrator has verified that
   the Trojan does not in fact exist on the users host. Additionally,

Caution

   Exclusions   should  be  setup  for  your  Services  Server,  so  that
   SecureServ  does  not try to scan ChanServ, or NickServ, or any of the
   bots relating to Nickname protection.

   Adding a Entry

   To add a entry to the Exclusion list, use the following format:
/msg SecureServ exclude add <host/Server/Channel> <type> <reason>

   Where:

   <host>  =  The  HostName/Server or Channel name. WildCards ? and * are
   permitted.

   <type>  = The type of exclusion. 0 is for HostNames, 1 is for Servers,
   and 2 is for channels.

   <reason>  =  a  short  description  of  the  exclusion,  for  operator
   reference only.

   The output is as follows:
>secureserv< exclude add #chan 2 Blah is my reason
-SecureServ- Added #chan (Channel) exception to list

   Listing an Entry

   To list the Exclusions simple type:
/msg SecureServ exclude list

   And  all  the  current exclusions are listed. Additionally, a Position
   number  is  provided for use with the delete command. The output is as
   follows:
>secureserv< exclude list
-SecureServ- Exception List:
-SecureServ- 1) *.blah.com (Server) Added by Fish for Blah is my reason
-SecureServ- 2) is.blah.com (HostName) Added by Fish for can by high
-SecureServ- 3) #chan (Channel) Added by Fish for Blah is my reason
-SecureServ- End of List.

   Deleting an Entry

   To  delete  a entry, you should first lookup the Position of the entry
   that you wish to delete. The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ exclude del <num>

   Where:

   <num> is the position of the entry you wish to delete in the list

   The output of the command is as follows:
>secureserv< exclude del 1
-SecureServ- Deleted #chan Channel out of exception list

2.2. Helper Lists

   Helper  lists  let  you  grant  non-privileged  users  the  ability to
   maintain your Virus help channel and help users that are infected with
   virus's  that  could be removed with simple instructions (such as Spam
   Virus's  that  infect  Mirc).  These  users are granted the ability to
   "release"  a  infected user from SecureServ or kill un-cooperative, or
   unresponsive  users  that SecureServ has identified as being infected.
   Users  that  have  been  joined  to  the  help  channel  are "held" by
   SecureServ  and  are usually prevented from joining other channels (if
   your  IRCd supports this option). This can be helpful so you can clean
   up  users  that  are infected with simple script based virus's and you
   require  their  attention  to  help  you  clean  their  computer. More
   information  about  the commands available to use on infected users is
   available via the assist command detailed below.

Caution

   Although  SecureServ  limits  who  a  "Helper" may kill (only infected
   users  joined  to  the  Help  Channel)  you should only give out login
   accounts to trusted users.

   Adding a Entry

   To add a entry to the Helper list, use the following format:
/msg SecureServ helpers add <login> <pass>

   Where:

   <login>  = The login name to use to gain access. Does not have to be a
   nickname.

   <pass> = The password to use to login

   The output is as follows:
>secureserv< helpers add myhelper mypass
-SecureServ- Successfully added Helper myhelper with Password mypass to Helpers
 List

   Listing an Entry

   To list the helpers simple type:
/msg SecureServ helpers list

   And  all  the  helpers  are  listed.  Additionally,  if  a nickname is
   provided  after the login name, it means that this nick is logged into
   this particular helper account.

   The output is as follows:
>secureserv< helpers list
-SecureServ- Helpers List (2):
-SecureServ- fish (Fish)
-SecureServ- myhelper (Not Logged In)
-SecureServ- End of List.

   Deleting an Entry

   To delete a entry, you must provide the login name you wish to delete.
   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ helpers del <login>

   Where:

   <login> is the login account you wish to delete.

   The output of the command is as follows:
>secureserv< helpers del myhelper
-SecureServ- Deleted myhelper from Helpers List

2.3. Username and Password for Dat File Updates

   In  order to update SecureServ's Detection, you need to register for a
   account  at  http://secure.irc-chat.net/  Once  you have received your
   username  and  password  via  email,  you  can  proceed  to  configure
   SecureServ  to  update Dat files automatically for you. SecureServ can
   be  configured to check for updates on a Daily Basis. You can, disable
   this  automatic  update  if  you  wish,  but  this  is  covered in the
   "Settings" Section.

   Once you have received your username and password, Issue the following
   command to SecureServ:
/msg SecureServ set updateinfo <username> <password>

   The output should be as follows:
>SecureServ< set updateinfo myusername myl33tpassword
-SecureServ- Update Username and Password has been updated to myusername and my
l33tpassword

   You  can  then  issue the following command to check that the username
   and  password are correct and also, update your dat file to the latest
   version automatically:
/msg secureserv update

   If all goes well, SecureServ should respond with:
>SecureServ< update
-SecureServ- Requesting New Dat File. Please Monitor the Services Channel for S
uccess/Failure
<SecureServ>/#services Fish requested a update to the Dat file
<SecureServ>/#ervices DatFile Version 32 has been downloaded and installed

   If  the  update failed for any reason, you will either not receive any
   message  about DatFile being downloaded and installed, or will receive
   a message detailing the problem.

2.4. System Messages

   SecureServ  sends  different  messages  to  users  depending  on whats
   happening. Examples of the messages its send is a "Warning message" to
   users that they are about to be checked for Virus's, and also messages
   when  they  AKILL  or  warn a user about a possible "Trojan/Infection"
   etc.  These  messages  can  be  customized  to  suit  your network, or
   language  of  choice  easily.  The different messages that you can set
   are:
     * "Greeting" messages
       Greeting Messages are sent to uses when they sign on your Network.
       They  are  just  to  inform  the user that a CTCP VERSION check is
       being conducted.
     * "AKILL" messages
       AKILL messages are sent to users when they are about to be akilled
       from your network due to a positive "infection". You could provide
       email  addresses,  contact  information,  should  the user wish to
       contact  you.  In  addition to the AKILL message, the user is also
       given a URL they can view with details about their "infection" and
       how to fix it.
     * "No Help Available" messages
       As  SecureServ  can  also  detect  Virus's,  some network may have
       channels  devoted  to  helping users remove virus's from their IRC
       clients.  SecureServ has a "Helper" login function that allows you
       to  setup  "non-oper"  or "oper" users to be helpers. If no one is
       logged  into  SecureServ  and  a  virus infected user is detected,
       instead  of  attempting  to  automatically  join him to the "Help"
       channel,  he  is akilled from the network. This message is sent to
       the  user to let them know that they have a virus, and should seek
       help.

   Setting  these  three  types  of  messages  is  simple. Just issue the
   following commands:
/msg SecureServ set signonmsg <message>
/msg SecureServ set akillmesg <message>
/msg SecureServ set nohelpmsg <message>

Note

   If you don't customize any of these messages, a Default system message
   is used automatically.

3. Detailed Configuration

   SecureServ  attempts  to  be  as  configurable as possible in order to
   cater  for  each individual networks requirements. This in turn though
   makes  the  configuration  very  complex. There are many many settings
   with SecureServ that affect how it operates, how it responds and even,
   how  affects  the  performance  of  NeoStats  Overall. Out of the box,
   SecureServ  provides sensible defaults for these settings, but you may
   wish  to  read  this  section  for details on exactly what each option
   does, and its affect on how SecureServ operates.

   The  following  list  summaries  the  available Options you can set in
   SecureServ
     * SPLITTIME
     * VERSION
     * CHECKFIZZER
     * DOONJOIN
     * DOPRIVCHAN
     * FLOODPROT
     * CHANKEY
     * CHANLOCKTIME
     * MULTICHECK
     * MONBOT
     * MONCHANCYCLE
     * MONCHANCYCLETIME
     * REPORT
     * AUTOSIGNOUT
     * JOINHELPCHAN
     * AKILL
     * AKILLTIME
     * DOJOIN
     * NFCOUNT
     * VERBOSE
     * CYCLETIME
     * AUTOUPDATE
     * SAMPLETIME
     * HELPCHAN
     * BOTECHO
     * TREATCHANMSGASPM

   To  change  any  of  these  settings,  you  use  the  Set Interface in
   SecureServ. Eg:
/msg SecureServ set <option> <params>

   To view the current settings, issue the following command:
/msg SecureServ set list

   The  following Sections describes the different options, their params,
   and the effect on SecureServ in detail.

3.1. SPLITTIME Setting

   SecureServ  Monitors  the  number  of  joins  on a Channel in order to
   determine  if  the channel is been attacked by FloodBots. In Order for
   SecureServ to help Determine what is a FloodBot attack, and what might
   be  a  simple  Net-Join,  it examines the time the user signed on IRC.
   This  value  determines  how  long  a  user  must be on IRC before its
   determined that their channel join is not part of a "FloodBot" attack.

   The  default setting for this option is 300 Seconds (5 Minutes, which,
   in  most  cases,  is  ideal  for most networks. You should not need to
   change this value.

Warning

   If  you  set  this  value to high, then during a netjoin (when 2 split
   servers  rejoin)  SecureServ  may determine that the users coming back
   from  the Split are FloodBots and Close down Channels. Be careful with
   modifying this value.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set SPLITTIME <seconds>

3.2. VERSION Setting

   When  users  sign  onto  your  IRC  network, SecureServ issues a "CTCP
   VERSION"  command  to  the clients, as many Trojans/WarScripts/Virus's
   have unique replies to CTCP Version requests.

   When SecureServ receives the reply, it compares it to the Definitions,
   and if there is a Match, will take action based on the Definition File
   (Either  AKILL  the  user,  Join  them  to a AV help channel, Warn the
   Operators, or just issue a warning message to the users)

   If  you  wish to turn off the CTCP VERSION checks, issue the following
   command
/msg SecureServ set VERSION <ON/OFF>

3.3. CHECKFIZZER Setting

   SecureServ  can Detect the Fizzer Worm on your IRC network. If you are
   not  affected  by Fizzer, its advisable to turn this option off, as it
   affects performance.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set CHECKFIZZER <ON/OFF>

3.4. DOONJOIN Setting

   This  setting  decides  if  SecureServ  should  perform  OnJoin  Virus
   Checking.  When  enabled,  every  CYCLETIME  Seconds,  SecureServ will
   create  a  psydo  user and join a random channel. When this setting is
   off, SecureServ will not check random channels for OnJoin Virus's.

   To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set DOONJOIN <ON/OFF>

3.5. DOPRIVCHAN Setting

   This  setting  controls  if  SecureServ's will check Private Channels.
   Private  Channels are defined by the Channel Modes +I, +k +s +p or +O.
   Enabling  this  option  forces  SecureServ  to  check  these channels.
   Disabling  this  feature  means  SecureServ  will  never  check  these
   channels unless forced via a /msg SecureServ check <chan>

   To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set DOPRIVCHAN <ON/OFF>

3.6. FLOODPROT

   This  setting  enables SecureServ to monitor the Channels for possible
   FloodBot attacks, and to temporarily set the channel +ik when a attack
   occurs.  This  option uses the settings from CHANLOCKTIME, SAMPLETIME,
   and CHANKEY to be configured to work correctly as well.

   To Change this setting, issue the following command:
/msg SecureServ set FLOODPROT <ON/OFF>

3.7. CHANKEY

   This  setting controls what key will be used when SecureServ "Locks" a
   channel  during  a attack. (+k key). You should try to change this key
   regularly so that attackers can not re-program their floodbots to gain
   access  to  your channels with a well known key. If you don't set this
   option,  SecureServ  uses  a  default  Key.  The length of this key is
   restricted,  and  if  you  try to set a key that is too long, you will
   receive a error message.

   To Change this setting, issue the following command:
/msg SecureServ set CHANKEY <newkey)

3.8. CHANLOCKTIME

   This  setting controls how long SecureServ will "Lock" a channel after
   detecting a attack. During this time, Channel Administrotors/Operators
   may  remove  the mode set, and SecureServ will not mind. If after this
   time  period  (+/-  10  seconds)  the channel will have the modes that
   SecureServ  set  automatically  removed,  so the channel can return to
   normal operation.

   To Change this setting, issue the following command:
/msg SecureServ set CHANLOCKTIME <seconds>

3.9. MULTICHECK Setting

   By  Default,  when  SecureServ  identifies  a  Positive  Match  for  a
   Trojan/VIrus  etc,  it  takes  action  straight away, and discontinues
   checking  for  any  other  matches. This option tells SecureServ, that
   even  if  it does find a Match, to continue checking, so that the user
   is warned of all matches, and not just the first one found.

Warning

   Enabling  MULTICHECK  on  a  large  network  is  not  advised  due  to
   performance reasons.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set MULTICHECK <ON/OFF>

3.10. MONBOT Setting

   SecureServ  has the option to assign one of the random bots to stay in
   a  channel  all  the time, instead of cycling like the ONJOIN bots do.
   This  option  sets  which  bot  will  be  used to monitor the channels
   specified  in  the  MONCHAN  command.  A  listing of available bots is
   obtained via the Bots Command. .

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set MONBOT <bot>

3.11. MONCHANCYCLE Setting

   This  setting  specifies  if  SecureServ  should  cycle  the MONCHAN's
   periodically  (by default, it cycles one channel interval specified by
   the  MONCHANCYCLETIME setting). This can help detect OnJoin virus's in
   the channels you specify a monitor bot should be placed.

   To Change this setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set MONCHANCYCLE <ON/OFF>

3.12. MONCHANCYCLETIME Setting

   This  setting specified the interval that SecureServ will cycle one of
   the  monchans.  By  Default,  if  MONCHANCYCLE  is  enabled,  every 30
   minutes,  one  of  the MONCHAN's be selected and the monbot will cycle
   the  channel  looking  for  ONJOIN  virus's.  For  example, if you are
   monitoring  4 channels, each channel will only be cycled every 2 hours
   (30 minutes x 4 channels) so you should adjust this value accordingly.

   To Change this setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set MONCHANCYCLETIME <seconds>

3.13. REPORT Setting

   SecureServ   has   the   option   to  report  positive  infections  to
   secure.irc-chat.net  site  for  both  statistically  and  in  future a
   blacklist type setup. Enabling this option means that statistics about
   infections  can  be reported to you on the secure.irc-chat.net site as
   well   as   providing  Summarized  data  to  the  public  (No  Private
   information,  such  as  infected hostnames, or your networks infection
   rate  is  reported  to the public though - See the secure.irc-chat.net
   site for more information.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set REPORT <ON/OFF>

3.14. AUTOSIGNOUT Setting

   SecureServ  has  the  ability to automatically logout helpers that set
   away  while being logged in. This ensures that infected users are only
   joined to the help channel if a helper is available to help them.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set AUTOSIGNOUT <ON/OFF>

3.15. JOINHELPCHAN Setting

   SecureServ  can optionally join the help channel with the first helper
   logs  in, and leave the help channel when the last helper logs out. No
   additional   functionality  is  provided  when  SecureServ  joins  the
   channel,  its  only  for the "look" and "feel" of having SecureServ in
   your antivirus channel.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set JOINHELPCHAN <ON/OFF>

3.16. AKILL Setting

   If  you  do  not  wish  SecureServ to ever AKILL a user for a positive
   match,  turn this option off. It will then just issue a warning to all
   operators  about  the Client, and Operators are free to do as they see
   fit.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set AKILL <ON/OFF>

3.17. AKILLTIME Setting

   This  setting  changes  the  Timeout value for AKILL's that SecureServ
   sets when it detects a "infection"

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set AKILLTIME <SECONDS>

3.18. DOJOIN Setting

   IF  SecureServ  detects  a  user  is  infected  with  a  virus, it can
   optionally  join  that  user  to  a  Antivirus  channel. If you do not
   operate  such  a channel on your network, then disable this option. If
   its is disabled, then the user will be AKILLED instead.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set DOJOIN <ON/OFF>

3.19. NFCOUNT Setting

   SecureServ  monitors  the  number of nick changes a user makes in a 10
   second  period. If the user exceeds a threshold, it considers the user
   to  be  performing  a  "nickflood"  and  will  akill the user from the
   network.  This  Setting  Control  how many nick changes in a 10 second
   period  the  user performs. The default is 5, which should be suitable
   for most users.

   To Change this Setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set NFCOUNT <number>

3.20. VERBOSE Setting

   If  you  like to know what SecureServ is doing (and like to be flooded
   in the #services channel, then enable this option.

Warning

   Not Recommended on a Large Network. SecureServ can get quiet busy!

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set VERBOSE <ON/OFF>

3.21. CYCLETIME Setting

   SecureServ automatically creates new "pseudo" users that randomly join
   channels  looking  for OnJoin virus's or SPAM. This option changes the
   interval  that SecureServ will Cycle the random users and channels. On
   a Large network, you should aim for a smaller value, so it covers more
   of  your  channels  quicker, but on a smaller network, this may become
   annoying for your users, so a higher value is recommended.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set CYCLETIME <SECONDS>

3.22. AUTOUPDATE Setting

   If  SecureServ  has  been  Configured with a username and password (as
   Covered  in  Section  2.2,  you  can  optionally  Setup  SecureServ to
   automatically check and download new dat files if available on a Daily
   basis.  If  you  prefer  to  manually  update  the  DAT files via /msg
   secureserv update, then disable this option

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set AUTOUPDATE <ON/OFF>

3.23. SAMPLETIME Setting

   As  previously mentioned, SecureServ monitors the number of joins on a
   particular  channel  over  a  period  of Time. Within SecureServ, this
   measurement  is known as "Average Joins Per Period" or AJPP for short.
   If this AJPP value is exceeded, SecureServ assumes that the Channel is
   under a floodbot attack, and will "close" the channel.

   This  setting  controls  the  AJPP  threshold.  Only experienced users
   should need to modify this setting.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set SAMPLETIME <SAMPLETIME> <JOINS>

3.24. HELPCHAN Setting

   If  your  network  has  a  AntiVirus Channel setup, HELPCHAN sets that
   channel name. The default is #nohack

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set HELPCHAN <NAME>

3.25. BOTECHO Setting

   This  option  enables  SecureServ  sending  messages any of the onjoin
   bots,  or  monbot  receives to the services channel. This can help you
   monitor for potentially new onjoin virus's, or monitor for spam users.

   To Change the setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set BOTECHO <ON/OFF>

3.26. TREATCHANMSGASPM

   This  option  changes  the way that SecureServ treats Channel Messages
   sent  to  channels  that  either  a  Onjoin  bot is a member off, or a
   channel  that  is being monitored via a MonBot. SecureServ has its own
   list  of  channel  messages that it considers as "bad" and will act on
   accordingly,  but  sometimes Spambots will spam a channel instead of a
   individual  user.  Enabling this option will cause SecureServ to check
   channel  messages  against  both  the  list  of Signatures for Private
   Messages as well as the list of Signatures for Channel Messages.

Warning

   Enabling  this  option  is  NOT a good idea if you have large channels
   with  lots  of chatter, as it is very very CPU intensive (and will get
   worse as we add more PM signatures to the official Viri.dat file). You
   should  only  enable  this  if  you enjoy wasting your CPU cycles. Its
   added  benifit  is  very small in terms of detection rates. As a extra
   pre-caution,  we make it difficult for you to enable this option. This
   should give you a idea of how *bad* it is to enable.

   To Change this setting, issue the following Command:
/msg SecureServ set TREATCHANMSGASPM <ON/OFF>

4. Operational Commands

   SecureServ  has a number of commands that you can issue it in order to
   perform  checks  or operations on your IRC network. These commands aid
   Administrators in keeping their network secure, and keeping SecureServ
   upto date.

   The following list summarizes these commands:
     * List
     * checkchan
     * cycle
     * status
     * update
     * login
     * logout
     * bots
     * monchan
     * assist
     * reload

   The following Sections Describe these commands in detail

4.1. list Command

   The  List  command  shows  a  brief  list  of all the Definitions that
   SecureServ  currently  has  loaded. These are direct from the Dat file
   that is downloaded from the http://secure.irc-chat.net website.

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ list
-SecureServ- Virus List:
-SecureServ- ===========
-SecureServ- 1) Virus: HTTPSpam. Detection: PM. Action: OpersWarn Hits: 0
-SecureServ- 2) Virus: IRCSpam. Detection: PM. Action: OpersWarn Hits: 0

-SecureServ- End of List.

   More    detail    about   each   "Virus"   can   be   found   at   the
   http://secure.irc-chat.net/ site by searching for the Virus Name.

4.2. CheckChan Command

   If  you  suspect  that  a  user in a Channel is infected with a OnJoin
   virus,  you  can force SecureServ to check the channel on your behalf.
   If  SecureServ  finds  any  infection in the channel, it will take the
   normal action associated with that virus.

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ checkchan <chan>

4.3. cycle Command

   This  command  forces  SecureServ  to  part the existing channel it is
   checking and join the next random Channel.

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ cycle

   The  next channel is chosen at random, but is guaranteed not to be the
   previous channel it checked.

4.4. status Command

   This  command gives the Administrator statistics on the how SecureServ
   is  performing, how many checks it has conducted, and currently logged
   in "helper" users.

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ status
-SecureServ- SecureServ Status:
-SecureServ- ==================
-SecureServ- Virus Patterns Loaded: 17
-SecureServ- CTCP Version Messages Scanned: 106287
-SecureServ- CTCP Messages Acted On: 1729

-SecureServ- Built-In Functions: 1
-SecureServ- AV Channel Helpers Logged in: 0
-SecureServ- Current Top AJPP: 28 (in 5 Seconds): #w4f
-SecureServ- End of List.

4.5. update Command

   That  command  forces  SecureServ  to  check  the  Dat File version at
   http://secure.irc-chat.net/   and   download  the  latest  version  if
   required.

Warning

   Repeated  use of this command in a short period of time will result in
   your  account  at  secure.irc-chat.net  being suspended for abuse. Use
   with CARE

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ update

4.6. login Command

   This  command  allows  a  "helper"  or  trusted  user  that  mans your
   Antivirus  or  help  channel to login to SecureServ to gain additional
   functionality  with  regards  to  handling infected users. The helpers
   must  have  a  valid  login account and password as set in the helpers
   command.

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ login <login> <pass>

4.7. logout Command

   This  command  allows a logged in helper to logout of SecureServ if he
   is  going to be away or not paying attention to the help channel for a
   period  of time. You should encourage your users to logout if they can
   not  provide timely response to infected users that may be forcejoined
   to the channel.

   The format of the command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ logout

4.8. bots Command

   This  option allows you to manipulate the random bot list that is used
   to  join  random  channels  (or  channels  monitored  with the monchan
   command, as detailed below). The available options are:
/msg SecureServ bots list

   This option lists all available bots.
/msg SecureServ bots add <nick> <ident> <host> <realname>

   This  option adds a bot with the nickname, ident, host and realname as
   specified  in  the  command  to  the list of bots that will be used to
   randomly join a channel.
/msg SecureServ bots del <num>

   This option lists will delete a bot from the available bots if its not
   currently in use.

4.9. monchan Command

   This option allows you to manipulate the list of channels that will be
   monitored all the time by SecureServ for Private Message type virus's.
   The  bot  that joins these channels is specified in the monbot section
   of  the  set command. You should also investigate the MONCHANCYCLE and
   MONCHANCYCLETIME  options  listed above on how to enable the monbot to
   cycle  these  monitored  channels,  as  a  OnJoin bot will not check a
   MONCHAN channel.
/msg SecureServ monchan list

   This  option  lists  all  the  channels that will be monitored. If the
   channels  do not exist when SecureServ is started, they will be joined
   when  the  first user joins the channel. When the last user leaves the
   channel, they will also leave the channel.
/msg SecureServ monchan add <chan>

   This option adds a channel to be monitored.
/msg SecureServ monchan del <chan>

   This option lists will delete a channel from the monitored list.

4.10. assist Command

   This  option  is  only  available  to  "helpers" that have logged into
   secureserv  and is used to control SecureServ's limits over users that
   have  been  identified as infected with simple virus's and joined to a
   help  channel.  They allow the "helpers" to either release a user from
   SecureServ's  restrictions,  or  kill un-cooperative, or un-responsive
   users  from the network. The helpers may only perform these actions on
   users  that SecureServ has identified as infected with a simple virus,
   and  automatically  joined to the help channel. Helpers may not "kill"
   users that SecureServ has NOT identified as infected.

   The format of the assist command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ assist release/kill <target>

   The  release  option allows the user to join all previous channels and
   continue  as  normal. After release is used on a user, a helper can no
   longer kill the target.

   The  kill option removes the user from the network via a akill command
   and  broadcasts a message to all opers indicating the helper that used
   the  kill  command,  and  the  initial virus the users was detected as
   having.

4.11. reload Command

   This  option reloads the viri.dat and customviri.dat files. Its no the
   same  as  a update command, as it does not attempt to download new dat
   files  from  http://secure.irc-chat.net site. Its useful if you make a
   change to your customviri.dat file.

   The format of the reload command is as follows:
/msg SecureServ reload

5. Custom Definitions

   You  can  create your own definitions to be used by SecureServ, but it
   requires a bit of programing skill, and knowledge of how to detect the
   trojan/virus.

   We  have  enabled  SecureServ  to obtain additional definitions from a
   custom,   administrator  defined  definition  file.  This  allows  IRC
   administrators  to  add  additional  signatures  to  SecureServ to ban
   clients  that  the  IRC network does not permit. A common signature is
   one  for  Bottlers  or  IRCork  clients. The only drawback is that the
   definition file is not simple, and some degree of programing knowledge
   is required.

5.1. Custom Definitions file

   If you wish to create your own custom definition, follow these steps:

5.1.1. Create customviri.dat file

   with  a  text  editor, create a new file called customviri.dat in your
   ~/NeoStats/data directory.

5.1.2. add entries to customviri.dat

   The format of the customviri.dat file is as follows:

   Example 1. customvir.dat

   name dettype 0 0 "detectionregex" "message" action

   It  is  very  important  that you follow the spacing format, otherwise
   your custom definition will fail to load.

   Each individual field is described below:

   name

   This  is  the Virus Name. It can be any combination of upper and lower
   case   characters   or   numbers,  but  can  not  contain  spaces,  or
   punctuation.

   dettype

   This  defines  how  SecureServ  should  use  this  signature to detect
   Trojans. Its a number and can only be one of the following:

   0  - CTCP Version check. This trys to match the detectionregex against
   a received CTCP version reply.

   1  -  Private Message. This trys to match the detectionregex against a
   private message received by the onjoin bots or monbot

   2 - Nick. This trys to match the detectionregex against a nickname.

   3 - Ident. This trys to match a detectionregex against a ident.

   4 - Realname. This trys to match a detectionregex against a users real
   name.

   5  -  Channel.  This  trys to match a detectionregex against a channel
   name.

   10 - Internal. This is reserved.

   detectionregex

   This field is used to define how to detect a Trojan. If for example in
   the dettype we specify a value of 0, then this is a regular expression
   that is applied to all CTCP VERSION replies that secureserv receives.

Warning

   This is a "Regular Expression" field. It is not the same as a wildcard
   field.  Regular  expressions  are  much more powerful pattern matching
   expressions  than  the  standard  ? and * options available in typical
   filesystem  or  IRC  pattern  matching  code.  If  you have never used
   regular  expression  before, I STRONGLY suggest you test your "Regular
   expression" code with a utility called "pcretest" available as part of
   libpcre  at  www.pcre.org.  Additionally,  you should try to learn the
   pattern matching language. This can be done by looking at the man page
   for  "perlre"  or  the documentation available on www.pcre.org. If you
   get  your  pattern  matching  code wrong, you have the ability to kill
   everyone on your IRC network, so be extremely careful.

   This  field  must be enclosed in double quotation marks (") and if you
   use " in your regular expression, you must escape them.

   message

   This  is the private message sent to the "Infected" user when they are
   matched  against this definition. As customviri.dat definitions do not
   direct  users  to the secure.irc-chat.net. site, you should provide as
   much  information  as  possible in this, or optionally, direct them to
   your  own hosted IRC page. You should place your message inside double
   quotation  marks  (") and if you use " in your regular expression, you
   must escape them.

   action

   This  field  defines  what SecureServ should do when it matches a user
   against this definition. The field is a number only and should only be
   one of the following.

   0  - SVSJOIN. On IRCds that support SVSJOIN, the user is automatically
   joined  to  the help channel, and any online opers are notified of the
   users infection. If no helpers are logged in, then the user is akilled
   instead.

   1 - AKILL. Akill the user from the IRC network.

   2  -  WARN.  Send  the  message  to the user indicating they matched a
   definition,  warn  the  operators via a global message, and do nothing
   else.

   3  -  NOTHING.  Only  send  the  message  to the user. Do not take any
   further action.

   We  don't  support  any  customviri.dat  definitions,  either  by  the
   secure.irc-chat.net  site,  or  via  our boards, though members of the
   community  may  choose to share their customviri.dat files. If you are
   in  doubt  or  unsure about creating your own customviri.dat files you
   should  always test them with the warn or nothing option as the action
   type until you are sure that you have the matching correct.

5.1.3. Reload the definitions

   If  SecureServ is already operating, you can reload the definitions by
   issuing  a  /msg  SecureServ reload command. This will make SecureServ
   reload both the viri.dat file as well as the customviri.dat file. Your
   customviri.dat  entries will be placed before any viri.dat entries, so
   if  you wish to override the action of a viri.dat entry, you can place
   a copy in the customviri.dat file.

6. Final Words

   This  Section  is my "Rant" for SecureServ. Although you don't need to
   read it to operate SecureServ, it does provide you some tips

6.1. Dealing with Un-detected Attacks/Trojans/Virus etc

   If  you come across a new "Trojan" or Virus or attack on your network,
   it  might  be possible to update SecureServ to be able to detect these
   new "Virus's"

   If  you  wish us to consider adding support to SecureServ's Definition
   files   for  new  "Virus's"  please  provide  us  with  the  following
   information  via  http://secure.irc-chat.net/  using  the "submit new"
   link (only available when logged in as a member)

   The following information is required:
     * the output from /whois <infected user>
       If  there  are  multiple  Infected  users, please provide multiple
       /whois outputs. This will aid us in determining a pattern.
     * The results from a /ctcp <infected user> version command, if any
     * Logfiles  extracts  of  the  behavior  of  the  bot that makes you
       suspect it is a new Trojan/Virus
       we  will  NOT  add detection to SecureServ for anything we can not
       verify  is in fact a risk to IRC security. If you submit to us the
       details  of  a script that a user is using, because you don't like
       the colors, Tough. Find some other way to deal with that user.
     * Details of your IRC network
       So  that we may contact you directly on your network if we require
       additional information or wish to the "Virus" in the wild.

   Before  adding new items to the Definitions, we do as much research as
   possible,  and  also  share this information with other "IRC Security"
   professionals or teams in order to determine the most effective way to
   detect this "infection"

   Additionally, we will add "warning" messages to users that are running
   old  copies  of  IRC  software  that are vulnerable to security issues
   (such as allows a Hacker to break into the users computer via IRC) and
   advise  the  user  to  upgrade  their  IRC client. If you are a client
   Author  of  a script or IRC client that has had Security Issues in the
   past,  and  wish  us  to add this "warning" to the Definitions, please
   contact us directly.
