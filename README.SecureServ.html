This document will aid you in setting up and running SercureServ on your IRC network.</p><p>SecureServ is a advanced IRC Trojan detector, much like a Virus Scanner, but aimed for IRC networks. Using Several different methods, including, but not limited to Version checks, Behavior analysis, and general pattern matching, it aims to detect Trojans and Virus's as well as FloodBots that connect to your IRC network.</p><p>SecureServ's "brains" are based on a "Definition file" or Dat file, that contain information on how to detect the trojans. This means to update SecureServ's detection for new Trojans/Bots only requires that you download a new dat file (which can be automated). There are some pre-conditions to obtaining new Dat files, and these can be found in the Installation chapter.</p><p>SecureServ can detect Trojan/Virus's or "Security Risks" to your Network a number of ways, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CTCP Version Checks</p></li><li><p>NickName Patterns</p></li><li><p>UserName (Ident) Patterns</p></li><li><p>RealName Patterns</p></li><li><p>Channel MemberShip Patterns</p></li><li><p>Private/Notice Messages</p></li><li><p>Channel Utilization</p></li><li><p>Logic Checks</p></li></ul></div><p>While we can detect a vast majority of Trojans, and its easy to extend SecureServ to detect new ones without Recompiling/upgrading, its not a fullproof solution. Additionally, Virus/Trojan/Bot authors are getting more and more sophisticated these days, and will always find ways to avoid detection. SecureServ aims to reduce the load on a Network Administration staff in dealing with these Trojans.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>As of writting, this software is BETA quality. Not all functionality has been implemented, and additionally, there might be some "BAD" bugs in SecureServ that cause it to AKILL your entire network. Our testing and Development of SecureServ was run on a 1500 user network, and so far, has proved stable, and effective in protecting our network, BUT every users enviroment is different. While we have taken all precautions and conducted a extensive QA cycle before the release of SecureServ, its a "Use at your Own Risk" Module. Of Course, if you do have bad experiences with SecureServ, please let us know at <a href="#">http://www.neostats.net/boards/</a></p></div><p>SecureServ is written and maintained by Justin Hammond. It requires the NeoStats software. More information about SecureServ, or NeoStats, can be found at <a href="#">http://www.neostats.net/</a></p><p>SecureServ is Copyright, 2003 by Justin Hammond.</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e50"></a>1.&nbsp;Prerequisites and Installation.</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>SecureServ is designed to run on Top of NeoStats. The Following requirements at the time of writting are required for NeoStats:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A Linux or BSD based Server or Shell.</p></li><li><p>A supported IRCd. Currently, Hybrid7, Unreal, Ultimate2.x or Ultimate3.x or NeoIRCd</p></li><li><p>Some basic Unix administration Skill</p></li><li><p>Of Course, a IRC network to connect it all together.</p></li></ul></div><p>Please refer to the NeoStats website for more information on the requirements</p><p>SecureServ itself requires the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NeoStats 2.5.3 or Higher correctly installed and Running</p></li><li><p>Libpcre (tested with version 3.9)</p></li><li><p>A account on <a href="#">http://secure.irc-chat.net</a> is required if you wish to take advantage of updated definition files</p></li><li><p>The time to read this entire document. </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>SecureServ has the potential to Akill/Gline your entire network. Its strongly suggested that you read this entire document before even attempting to compile SecureServ, as I'm just going to laugh, if you didn't read, and it AKILL's your entire network. This is Beta Software, there are BUGS. beware.</p></div></li></ul></div><p>The requirement to have a valid account on <a href="#">http://secure.irc-chat.net</a> is due to the fact that I want to have some control over who recieves the definition files. If these Definition files fall into the hands of the TrojanWritters or Virus Writers, its possible they might be able to re-write their bots to avoid detection. Please see the website for more information.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e96"></a>1.1.&nbsp;Compiling and Installation</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>As long as you have successfully setup NeoStats, and installed it correctly, Compiling SecureServ is very simple and straight forward. First you must extract the files from the download package. This is as simple as:</p><pre class="screen">bash$<b class="command"> tar -xzf SecureServ-&lt;ver&gt;.tar.gz</b></pre><p>This should then create a directory called SecureServ-&lt;version&gt; where &lt;version&gt; is the Version of SecureServ. Then Proceed to Change into the SecureServ directory, and run Configure as follows:</p><pre class="screen">bash$<b class="command">./configure [--enable-debug | --with-neostats=&lt;dir&gt;]</b></pre><p>--enable-debug is only usefull for diagnostics purposes when used in conjuction with debugging tools. There should be no need to use this option on a day to day basis</p><p>--with-neostats=&lt;dir&gt; should be used if your neostats directory is not in a standard location (~/NeoStats/). Replace &lt;dir&gt; with the full path to your NeoStats installation directory (NOT SOURCE DIRECTORY)</p><p>Configuring SecureServ will look something like the following screen:</p><pre class="screen">[Fish@fish-dt]$ ./configure

Examples of the messages its send is a "Warning message" to users that they are about to be checked for Virus's, and also messages when they AKILL or warn a user about a possible "Trojan/Infection" etc. These messages can be customized to suit your network, or language of choice easily. The different messages that you can set are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>"Greeting" messages</p><p>Greeting Messages are sent to uses when they sign on your Network. They are just to inform the user that a CTCP VERSION check is being conducted.</p></li><li><p>"AKILL" messages</p><p>AKILL messages are sent to users when they are about to be akilled from your network due to a positive "infection". You could provide email addresses, contact information, should the user wish to contact you. In addition to the AKILL message, the user is also given a URL they can view with details about their "infection" and how to fix it.</p></li><li><p>"No Help Available" messages</p><p>As SecureServ can also detect Virus's, some network may have channels devoted to helping users remove virus's from their IRC clients. SecureServ has a "Helper" login function that allows you to setup "non-oper" or "oper" users to be helpers. If no one is logged into SecureServ and a virus infected user is detected, instead of attempting to automatically join him to the "Help" channel, he is akilled from the network. This message is sent to the user to let them know that they have a virus, and should seek help.</p></li></ul></div><p>Setting these three types of messages is simple. Just issue the following commands:</p><pre class="screen">/msg SecureServ set signonmsg &lt;message&gt;</pre><pre class="screen">/msg SecureServ set akillmesg &lt;message&gt;</pre><pre class="screen">/msg SecureServ set nohelpmsg &lt;message&gt;</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If you don't customize any of these messages, a Default system message is used automatically.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e268"></a>3.&nbsp;Detailed Configuration</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>SecureServ attempts to be as configurable as possible in order to cater for each individual networks requirements. This in turn though makes the configuration very complex. There are many many settings with SecureServ that affect how it operates, how it responds and even, how affects the performance of NeoStats Overall. Out of the box, SecureServ provides sensible defaults for these settings, but you may wish to read this section for details on exactly what each option does, and its affect on how SecureServ operates.</p><p>The following list summaries the available Options you can set in SecureServ</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SPLITTIME</p></li><li><p>VERSION</p></li><li><p>CHECKFIZZER</p></li><li><p>DOONJOIN</p></li><li><p>MULTICHECK</p></li><li><p>AKILL</p></li><li><p>AKILLTIME</p></li><li><p>DOJOIN</p></li><li><p>NFCOUNT</p></li><li><p>VERBOSE</p></li><li><p>CYCLETIME</p></li><li><p>AUTOUPDATE</p></li><li><p>SAMPLETIME</p></li><li><p>HELPCHAN</p></li></ul></div><p>To change any of these settings, you use the Set Interface in SecureServ.

In Order for SecureServ to help Determine what is a FloodBot attack, and what might be a simple Net-Join, it exaimes the time the user signed on IRC. This value determines how long a user must be on IRC before its determined that their channel join is not part of a "FloodBot" attack.</p><p>The default setting for this option is 300 Seconds (5 Minutes, which, in most cases, is ideal for most networks.
