SecureServ 0.9.1 Release Notes - 30/5/2003
========================================
THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE. YOU ARE WARNED.

TODO List.
- Not everything I had planned for SecureServ is implemented in this
  release. This includes:
  - Anti Virus Channel Support Functions

- NickFlood Code has been implemented, but not enforced. You will get
  messages in your services channel if SecureServ detects NickFloods, but it
  wont actually do anything (yet)

- FloodDetection on Channels should be more Accurate now (But it still
  doesn't actually take action)

- Those people that had problems with libpcre in the 0.9 version should be
  able to compile and use this version with no problems.

- If you wish to take advantage of updated Definition files, you *MUST*
  apply for a account at http://secure.irc-chat.net/ (currently 80
  Signatures)

- If you have a http://secure.irc-chat.net account and have entered your
  username and password into SecureServ, AutoUpdate now functions. It
  automatically downloads new dat files every 24 hours. 

- Read the README file Please. It contains VERY important information. Read
  it again if you have already read it, there are new options you need to be
  aware of.
